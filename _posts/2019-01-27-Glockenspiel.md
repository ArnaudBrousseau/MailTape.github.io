<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Adrian Dollemore of [Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) to select three Sunday morning tunes for us on MailTape.
<br><br>
Using tapes, electronics and guitars through chains of effects, [Adrian Dollemore](https://twitter.com/AdeGlockenspiel)'s own music is hypnagogic, employing earth-ground chords and astrally-projective processing to paint a rural tonality with a bristling white afterglow.
<br><br></p>


# Glockenspiel's selection

## [Dedekind Cut](https://soundcloud.com/leebannon/) – Tahoe
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**A beautiful atmospheric synth/string piece. Really simple and looping but it's one of those hooks that really stun you. I'd love to hear it really loud through a good P.A. I believe he played at one of those all night shows in eastern Europe that you can sleep at, which must have been incredible, if you weren't actually alseep. Or maybe even if you were! **"**

## [Shida Shahabi](https://shidashahabi.com/) – Abisme
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**I've only discovered her music recently. She's a Swedish/Iranian Pianist. I was blown away by the level of texture on her  album. At a guess it probably results from clever micing of her piano but there's something utterly beguiling about the minimalism. There's an element of Satie and French romantic, but as much as like both of those, this goes way beyond. Completely enchanting.**"**

## Ancient Colours – Field and Woodland Strewn, the Failing Sun
_Adrian Dollemore_: **"**This is by Simon Allum. A friend of mine whose guitar playing I enjoy very much. I recorded his album for the [Preserved Sound](http://www.preservedsound.com/) label a few years ago but wasn't involved with this one. This is a longer piece and I like how it stretches out and ebbs and flows over ten minutes or so without any augmentation from other instruments. Keeping sole space for the guitar to unfold, which it certainly does. There's some lovely picking going on, he really knows his tunings. Hopefully he will make some more!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Glockenspiel – The Endless Road 2
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from Tara's '[Fundamentals](https://tararodgers.bandcamp.com/album/fundamentals-ep)' EP, this track feels effortlessly light on its feet with its broken drum pattern, vaporous chords, thrumming bass and euphoric timbre.**"**

## Oren Ambarchi – The Strouhal Number
_Sanjay_: **"**The nine tracks that make up [Dawn of Midi](http://dawnofmidi.com/)'s album, Dysnomia, are really one long suite. It's contemplative, spacious, gentle and quiet—while carrying a propulsive rhythm. With Aakaash Israni on contrabass, Qasim Naqvi on drums and Amino Belyamani on piano, Dawn of Midi bridge the gap between anthropomorph and computer by refusing to dichotomise the two.**"**

## Joanna Brouk – Going Through the Veil: Becoming a Swan
_Sanjay_: **"**I've been hoping to see [Jlin](https://soundcloud.com/jlinnarlei) perform live for a while. This one is taken from 'Autobiography': Jlin's soundtrack to the staged life story of dancer and choreographer [Wayne McGregor](https://waynemcgregor.com/), which opened in October 2017 and ran at Sadler’s Wells in London until summer 2018. Probably closest in percussive palette to Jlin's debut album, [Black Origami](https://planet.mu/releases/black-origami/), this track is all galloping drums, echoing claps and gliding shakers.**"**

## Maisha – Welcome To A New Welcome
_Sanjay_: **"**A brilliant collaboration between two of my favourite contemporary producers, [King Britt](http://www.kingbritt.com/) and [Moor Mother](https://www.mailta.pe/269/moor-mother/). In Camae's own words, 'Time Floats speaks about the environmental warfare that continues to plague historical African American and low income communities'.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening to this episode. Much love and respect to [Adrian Dollemore of Glockenspiel](https://babel-label.bandcamp.com/album/dupleix) for his Sunday selections today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
