<p id="introduction">This morning, Nicolas Cruz</p>

# Cruzzzzzz

Nicolas Cruz
 
# Nicola Cruz's selection:

## Radiohead - Daydreaming

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**This song from the new album of Radiohead is perfect the perfect transition for landing night dreams. Is one of those songs I listen to while still on bed, looking up the ceiling with my eyes open.**"**

## Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith - Labyrinth II

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**Beautiful harmonies to start the day: warm analogue sound inspires to be creative in music and in life. It all seems like is going to be a sunny one.**"**

## Devendra Banhart - Santa Maria da Feira

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**A little bit of romance and songwriting skills from this one. Soothing Brazilian influenced rhythms and colours to get into the shower.**"**
