<p id="introduction">Bright and delightful morning to the masses and the listeners, to the frequency lovers and addicted souls of the music empire. Today, “Ménage à trois” will tickle you with their harmonious selection and singular sound.</p>

# Ménage à Trois'selection

On a Sunday morning I would like to wake up with this track first;

## Rod Stewart - This Old Heart Of Mine (Ocean Edits)

For a mellow start to wake up slowly to and to soothe any hangover from the night before, let the soothing tines wash over your tired brain

## June - Lost Area (Dj Sprinkles' Empty Dancefoor)
then this for memories of the weekend, but presented in a more palatable manner for a sunday morning
"you made it" positive rammifications of the empty dancefloor

## Dream Lovers - For Belgian Friends
and finally for memories of summers past at MIDI festival in Hyeres, a cover of the classic Durutti Column track. A release by a boutique label from Manchester who also released "Conditional Love" a few years ago on one of the compilation E.Ps.
