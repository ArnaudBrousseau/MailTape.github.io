# Jally Kebba Susso's selection


## Ballaké Sissoko & Vincent Ségal – Chamber Music
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**This song is really evocative to me. It reminds me of growing up in Gambia. When the elders are sitting down at night time doing their sumuog, when they gather together to play music and have conversations. Depending on who was around you’d hear the balaphon and kora played. It’s a soothing song. Soothing and emotional.**"**

## Soriba Kouyaté – Kanakassi
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**Just beautiful. THIS is the definition of beauty. And this song is one of my biggest inspirations. Even when I am angry, I can listen to this song and it calms me right down… Soriba was light-years ahead of his time in terms of his versatility and innovation. I learnt a lot from him. But he is no more now. He passed away… It is unique song. It can always take you on a journey.**"**

## James Brown – This is a Man’s World
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**James Brown, man. The technicality of how he puts his music together—the instrumentation—is something that is beyond expression. I can just feel it. It is unfiltered. Straight from his heart. When you listen to it it touches you straight. His music has opened lots of doors for me, inspirationally. The music has lots of elements that to me represent different things. It is very colourful. It feels like it is going to go somewhere, in a different direction, but it keeps you right there... in a great way.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jally Kebba Susso – Ajama
_Sanjay_: **"**Written and recorded with the help of his band, Manding Sabu, Jally Kebba Susso's album 'Banjul-London' is guided by rhythms, dances and stories written, sung and played by a burgeoning line of “London-griots”.**"**

## Faith Mussa – Mdidi
_Sanjay_: **"**I saw [Faith Mussa](http://faithmussa.com/) supporting Jally Kebba Susso at [Dalston Curve Garden](http://dalstongarden.org/) in London earlier this month, and he played with seemingly boundless energy. His one man band act is impressive and anyone who thinks Ed Sheeran can do some good loops should see Faith Mussa show how it’s really done.**"**

##  Miriam Makeba – Liwawechi
_Sanjay_: **"**Writing about [Miriam Makeba](http://www.miriammakeba.co.za/) is a daunting task. And one I'm not really qualified to do. More generally, this track is taken from 'Homeland'—her first album recorded in South Africa since recording with the Manhattan Brothers in the late 1950s. Writing in 1989, Carol Cooper claimed that '[Miriam] sings with the smoky tones and delicate phrasing of Ella Fitzgerald, and when the occasion demands, she summons up the brassy showmanship of Ethel Merman and the intimate warmth of Frank Sinatra'.**"**

## Sona Jobarteh – Saya
_Sanjay_: **"**This is a haunting track described as a song 'about loss and of the feeling you are left with and the pain one suffers'. If you're in London on 18th June, Sona will be performing at the [Jazz Cafe](https://thejazzcafelondon.com/event/sona-jobarteh).**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jally Kebba Susso](http://jallykebbasusso.com/), and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
