# Les Graciés's selection


## Joni Mitchell – Hejira
_Eric Douglas Porter_: **"**There’s comfort in melancholy, when there is no need to explain“, a line that hooks a young adult discovering the separation of feelings and actions of the carefree youth of ones past. Ms Mitchell is a master of the written word and the songs crafted as accompaniment only solidify her genius. This song speaks directly to the artists looking to secure their place in history, to leave their mark in the world. Weary travelers following their passions, leaving only a blip on the radar of history.**"**

## Al Jarreau – Brite ‘N’ Sunny Babe
_Eric Douglas Porter_: **"**Brite ‘N’ Sunny Babe is a quintessential Sunday morning tune from me that goes back all the way to my childhood. Basically I would play this song along with all the songs from this album as a youth on the weekends, singing along, playing “air” keyboards dreaming of being a member in this band. The music felt so good it brought joy to an otherwise boring Sunday morning of a kid with no siblings in the home to keep company. Now as an adult the music sounds even more sweet and complete, medicinal! We both have him as a longtime musical reference and a place to recharge.**"**

## Joseph Malik – Melodies
_Gaël Segalen_: **"**Ample track velvet voice open notes angels choir.

space for the listener to answer and question at its turn.

First song of the album "Diverse", accompanying me for my first trip to the US, a bit anxious to pose step to Los Angeles for the first time, a song that I was listening to in the plane during my flight, to soothe and give force, feeling fragile, feeling strong, a new birth, ready for a culture shock.

There's a form of suspended time, wandering and a sense of a bigger community in there, promises to meet new people, we aren't alone, but connected souls. Perfect also to wander in airports during stop overs and observe people, trying to read through them. 

We realised that we both refer to/like Joseph Malik and we somehow were both wondering where's he's been gone...We got the answer later via our record label owner who had a band with him in the 90's! And we will let you find out by yourself.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jally Kebba Susso – Ajama
_Sanjay_: **"**Written and recorded with the help of his band, Manding Sabu, Jally Kebba Susso's album 'Banjul-London' is guided by rhythms, dances and stories written, sung and played by a burgeoning line of “London-griots”.**"**

## Faith Mussa – Mdidi
_Sanjay_: **"**I saw [Faith Mussa](http://faithmussa.com/) supporting Jally Kebba Susso at [Dalston Curve Garden](http://dalstongarden.org/) in London earlier this month, and he played with seemingly boundless energy. His one man band act is impressive and anyone who thinks Ed Sheeran can do some good loops should see Faith Mussa show how it’s really done.**"**

##  Miriam Makeba – Liwawechi
_Sanjay_: **"**Writing about [Miriam Makeba](http://www.miriammakeba.co.za/) is a daunting task. And one I'm not really qualified to do. More generally, this track is taken from 'Homeland'—her first album recorded in South Africa since recording with the Manhattan Brothers in the late 1950s. Writing in 1989, Carol Cooper claimed that '[Miriam] sings with the smoky tones and delicate phrasing of Ella Fitzgerald, and when the occasion demands, she summons up the brassy showmanship of Ethel Merman and the intimate warmth of Frank Sinatra'.**"**

## Sona Jobarteh – Saya
_Sanjay_: **"**This is a haunting track described as a song 'about loss and of the feeling you are left with and the pain one suffers'. If you're in London on 18th June, Sona will be performing at the [Jazz Cafe](https://thejazzcafelondon.com/event/sona-jobarteh).**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jally Kebba Susso](http://jallykebbasusso.com/), and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
