# Asagaya’s morning inspiration
 
## Jay Prince - Phase
_Asagaya:_ **"I had the privilege to work with Jay Prince on my album thanks to Guts and his never-falling intuition. Jay Prince is young, humble and talented. I really appreciate this track for its melancholic mood."**
 
## Tricky - Ghetto Stars
_Asagaya:_ **"Tricky belongs those who made me want to buy my first machines, produce my own tracks and write my lyrics. 
I have followed his work since I'm a teenager until now and he keeps dazzling me."**
 
## The Budos Band - The Sticks
_Asagaya:_ **"The band I always dreamned of. The soul, the power, the darkness, beers... They've got the whole package.
Their albums are really elaborate and their shows are phenomenal ; I'm a total fan."**
