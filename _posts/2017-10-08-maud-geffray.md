<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# Maud Geffray's selection

## Alessandro Cortini — Scappa
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**I love that guy, Alessandro was the keyboard of NIN during a few years, what he does under his own name is incredible. He’s based in L.A. and is one of the best musician from this modular synth scene. Just perfect for a sunday morning.**"**

## Lana Del Rey - Love
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Tragic romance, some of my friends wouldn’t share my pleasure, but that’s a real personal one.**"**

## Casual Gabberz — Inutile de fuir (la compilation)
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Crescendo. Casual Gabberz's compilation is perfect to give me power for the rest of the day.**"**
_Louise_ :  **"**The compilation is made of 51 bombers tracks, I couldn't fit them all in this tape, so I chose the first track : Evil Grace — Bim Bim. If you liked this track, please go check out [the whole tape](https://soundcloud.com/casualgabberz/sets/inutile-de-fuir-casual-gabberz-va)!**"**
