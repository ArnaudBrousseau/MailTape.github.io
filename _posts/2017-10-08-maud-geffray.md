<p id="introduction">This morning, the amazing producer [Maud Geffray](https://www.facebook.com/maudgeffray75/) has join us. Her solo album POLAAR is a gem of cold electronic music with many layers to dig into. Today's MailTape is a rollercoaster of emotions and feelings melted in eletronic sounds. I hope you are ready for the ride! I'm really proud of this episode, so let me know your thoughts on this.</p>

# Maud Geffray's selection

## Alessandro Cortini — Scappa
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**I love that guy, Alessandro was the keyboard of NIN during a few years, what he does under his own name is incredible. He’s based in L.A. and is one of the best musician from this modular synth scene. Just perfect for a sunday morning.**"**

## Lana Del Rey - Love
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Tragic romance, some of my friends wouldn’t share my pleasure, but that’s a real personal one.**"**

## Casual Gabberz — Inutile de fuir (la compilation)
_Maud Geffray_ : **"**Crescendo. [Casual Gabberz's compilation](https://soundcloud.com/casualgabberz/sets/inutile-de-fuir-casual-gabberz-va) is perfect to give me power for the rest of the day.**"**

_Louise_ :  **"**The compilation is made of 51 banger tracks, I couldn't fit them all in this tape, so Maud chose the track **Lycamobile by Paul Seul**. If you liked this track, please go check out [the whole tape](https://soundcloud.com/casualgabberz/sets/inutile-de-fuir-casual-gabberz-va)!**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Maud Geffray — Polaar
_Louise_ : **"**This is the opening track of the eponym album of Maud Geffray. With this song, I feel like I can acheive anything. There's is something very cinematographic in it — as the rest of the LP. It blows me away... to another world.**"**

## Helena Hauff — Gift
_Louise_ : **"**This Helena Hauff track is perfect to start up the day! Some good synths and rythmn to kick your butt and boost your energy. It builds up in an amazing way!**"**

## Gang Sign — Prequel
_Louise_ : **"**As always when working on MailTape, I've been lost on Soundcloud. This track appears like it's gonna be a pop song at the beginning... but there's this fast synth that comes in and turn it into something more electronic. I love how this track evolves in something I didn't see coming.**"**

## Hiroshi Yoshimura (吉村弘) — Dance PM
_Louise_ : **"**I felt like I had to have something really smooth to close this tape. I was amazed when I found this japanese 80's song from Hiroshi Yoshimura. Couldn't find a better track to end this tape. Ambient at its best!**"**
