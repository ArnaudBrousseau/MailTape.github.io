<p id="introduction">This wonderfully bright morning we are thrilled to welcome Brooklyn-based beatsmith, [Jitwam](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/), to MailTape. His languid and soulful selections slowly evaporate the dew and drags the melodies out into the light.</p>
<p>On his full-length debut, ज़ितम सिहँ, Jitwam.</p>


# Jitwam's selection


## Cara Tivey Trio – Contemplation
_Jitwam_: **"**Wake up slow...let the world come to you. Cara Tivey on keysss and blissful harmonies.**"**

## Jay Electronica – Dear Moleskine
_Jitwam_: **"**Jay Electronica is light. No matter how fast he raps, his words enter my consciousness so slowwww. An inspiration for the inspired.**"**

## Sam Reed – Love Ain't Free
_Jitwam_: **"**If you wants to feels good you got to listen to music that makes you feel good. This tune always puts a spring in my step, and some melancholy in my whistle.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jitwam. – Alone
_Sanjay_: **"**This arrangement includes wonderfully layered textures of violin, augmented by the spare but moving contributions of keyboard, guitar, drums and bass. [Gaelynn](https://violinscratches.com/)'s voice hovers above the music which builds slowly and carefully.**"**

## Henry Wu – Shahada
_Sanjay_: **"**Set to an ominous template, [Diane](http://dianecluck.info/)'s soft and warbling voice sits alongside acoustic guitars that circle minor chords and pentatonic progressions. A great reminder that sometimes less is more.**"**

## Nabihah Iqbal – Eden Piece
_Sanjay_: **"**A simple arrangement but a very important statement. This song, released in 1964, tears at the heart of the American dream—opportunity, justice, capitalism, freedom—by reminding the country (as well as Europe) of its historical and continuing colonisation of stolen land and its brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.**"**

## Yves Tumor – The Feeling When You Walk Away
_Sanjay_: **"**And we finish this tape with three of Mali's finest musicians, performing collectively as [Trio Da Kali](http://www.triodakali-kronosquartet.com/). Between the  balafon, ngoni and Hawa Kassé Mady's powerful voice, they switch from gently rippling passages to rapid-fire solos to pulsating bass lines that underpin much of the songs.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Gaelynn Lea](https://violinscratches.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
