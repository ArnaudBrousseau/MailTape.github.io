<p id="introduction">This wonderfully bright morning we are thrilled to welcome Brooklyn-based beatsmith, [Jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/), to MailTape. His languid and soulful selections slowly evaporate the dew and drag the melodies out into the light.</p>
<p>On his full-length debut, [ज़ितम सिहँ](https://cosmic-compositions.bandcamp.com/album/--2), Jitwam. deconstructs samples of folk and jazz guitar as they buzz and hiss alongside the warm reverie of vinyl drum samples.</p>


# Jitwam.'s selection


## Cara Tivey Trio – Contemplation
_Jitwam_: **"**Wake up slow...let the world come to you. Cara Tivey on keysss and blissful harmonies.**"**

## Jay Electronica – Dear Moleskine
_Jitwam_: **"**Jay Electronica is light. No matter how fast he raps, his words enter my consciousness so slowwww. An inspiration for the inspired.**"**

## Sam Reed – Love Ain't Free
_Jitwam_: **"**If you wants to feels good you got to listen to music that makes you feel good. This tune always puts a spring in my step, and some melancholy in my whistle.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jitwam. – Alone
_Sanjay_: **"**There's a simmering storm beneath the acoustic strums of this track, coerced by generous helpings of reverb and musing on isolation.**"**

## Henry Wu – Shahada
_Sanjay_: **"**[Henry Wu](http://www.smarturl.it/kw-thereturn) and [Kieron Ifill](http://blog.nutriot.com/tag/kieron-ifill) combine to provide a two-step bedrock for delicate strings to glide over, sitting alongside an infectious and restless b-line with just enough groove for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Nabihah Iqbal – Eden Piece
_Sanjay_: **"**Lull yourself into a hazy dream this morning with [Nabihah Iqbal](https://nabihahiqbal.bandcamp.com/)'s pared-back track, Eden Piece. All wandering and lilting piano lines and breathy vocals.**"**

## Yves Tumor – The Feeling When You Walk Away
_Sanjay_: **"**From a cavernous looping riff reveals Yves Tumor’s voice, an anguished falsetto steeped in phantasmal echoes that sounds as if it’s simultaneously vanishing just as it’s appearing. Between these disemfull of muffled vocals softly lamenting the cruelty of love, and the feelings they produce.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Gaelynn Lea](https://violinscratches.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
