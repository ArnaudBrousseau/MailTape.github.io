# AMA//MIZU's selection

## [Alogte Oho and his Sounds of Joy](https://alogteohoandhissoundsofjoy.bandcamp.com) – Mam Yinne Wa 
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**A gem from Ghana, a mix of Ghanaian music, gospel and some kind of 1930’s type of classical arrangement.
There’s so much to hear in this track, every listening gets better and I can’t get enough of these beautiful arrangements and rhythms it is so enchanting!**"**

## [Georgia Anne Muldrow](https://georgiaannemuldrow.bandcamp.com/) - Husfriend
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**This is for your Sunday chill . Georgia Anne Muldrow produced by Madlib, two giants colliding on this heavy beat.
I absolutely adore Georgia Anne Muldrow’s melodies and phrasing and combined with Madlib’s production it’s just honey for your ears.**"**

## Simon Diaz - Tonada de luna llena
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**This is a track from Venezuelan artist Simon Diaz that I have recently fell in love with.
It was recommended to me by Neva, the singer of IUNA NIVA and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it.
Everything is perfect in this song, Simon Diaz’s way of enunciating the same verses and his angelic soprano voice, the soft guitar holding this fragile ensemble in its palm.
To listen to on full moon Sundays.**"**
