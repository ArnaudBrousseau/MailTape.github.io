<p id="introduction">This morning we are dsddss</p>


# AMA//MIZU's selection

## [Alogte Oho and his Sounds of Joy](https://alogteohoandhissoundsofjoy.bandcamp.com) – Mam Yinne Wa 
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**A gem from Ghana, a mix of Ghanaian music, gospel and some kind of 1930’s type of classical arrangement.
There’s so much to hear in this track, every listening gets better and I can’t get enough of these beautiful arrangements and rhythms it is so enchanting!**"**

## [Georgia Anne Muldrow](https://georgiaannemuldrow.bandcamp.com/) - Husfriend
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**This is for your Sunday chill . Georgia Anne Muldrow produced by Madlib, two giants colliding on this heavy beat.
I absolutely adore Georgia Anne Muldrow’s melodies and phrasing and combined with Madlib’s production it’s just honey for your ears.**"**

## Simon Diaz - Tonada de luna llena
_AMA//MIZU_: **"**This is a track from Venezuelan artist Simon Diaz that I have recently fell in love with.
It was recommended to me by Neva, the singer of IUNA NIVA and I haven’t been able to stop listening to it.
Everything is perfect in this song, Simon Diaz’s way of enunciating the same verses and his angelic soprano voice, the soft guitar holding this fragile ensemble in its palm.
To listen to on full moon Sundays.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## AMA//MIZU – Dead Slept Rough
_Sanjay_: **"**This is a neatly structured track taken from Julia Biel's self-titled LP released last year. Opening with an instrumental section and then a change of tempo when the vocals are introduced, it compels the listener to exercise their anger and criticism towards the reality of an insidious link between state apparatus and the economy and big corporations.**"**

## Laura Nyro – Upstairs By a Chinese Lamp
_Sanjay_: **"**In most of [Laura Nyro](http://www.lauranyro.com/)'s songs you never quite know where she's (melodically and rhythmically) going to go, but it's always worth stringing along for the ride. This torchy lullaby set against a hushed orchestration from her 1970 album, Christmas and the Beads of Sweat, is one of my favourites.**"**

## [Our Native Daughters](https://folkways.si.edu/songs-of-our-native-daughters) – Quasheba, Quasheba
_Sanjay_: **"**Released just a few weeks ago with the 'Songs of Our Native Daughters' LP, “Quasheba, Quasheba” is a simmering track that slowly builds, with Dirk Powell and Leyla McCalla adding cello and electric guitar accompaniment to Allison Russell's vocal. After Allison found out her family line can be traced back to an enslaved person named Quasheba, this track—as well as the LP itself—sheds light on African-American women’s stories of struggle, resistance, and hope, and confronts the sanitised and perfumed views about America’s history (and continued structural support) of slavery, racism and misogyny.**"**

## Keyvan Chemirani & Pandit Anindo Chatterjee – Bhairavi
_Sanjay_: **"**Paris-based [Keyvan Chemirani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemirani_Ensemble) is known for his mastery of the traditional Persian hand drum zarb or tombac, and [Anindo Chatterjee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anindo_Chatterjee) likewise for the South Asian tabla. On their album, Battements au coeur de l'Orient, the two virtuoso musicians—alongside [Ken Zuckerman](http://www.kenzuckerman.com/) on sarod, [Sokratis Sinopoulos](https://www.sokratissinopoulos.com/) on kementché and laouto, [Bijan Chemirani](http://bijanchemirani.com/) on zarb and saz, [Stelios Petrakis](http://www.steliospetrakis.com/) on lyra and [Henri Tournier](http://www.henritournier.fr/home.html) on bansuri—alternate compositions and adaptations of poems sung by [Maryam Chemirani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HOqg3MQYiM).**"**
