<p id="introduction">This morning we attempt to provide you with a soundtrack to the water crystallising under freezing temperatures by welcoming the Paris-based collective, [Oiseaux-Tempête](http://www.oiseaux-tempete.com/), to MailTape.</p>
<p>Following the release of AL-‘AN ! الآن (And your night is your shadow — a fairy-tale piece of land to make our dreams) this year, Oiseaux-Tempête will be releasing a new live album in 2018 entitled TARAB طَرَبٌ. And if that doesn't satisfy you, they'll also be [on tour](http://www.oiseaux-tempete.com/tour.html) for most of January and February.</p>


# Félicia Atkinson's selection



## Tomoko Sauvage – Musique Hydromantique
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Wake up early enough to see the sun rise and breathe its energy.**"**

## Luc Ferrari – Presque rien n°1, le lever du jour au bord de la mer
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Let the silence becomes music and contemplate the light changing.**"**

## Cinema – Sem Toto
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Jump and raise your arms to the sun. It’s gonna be a good day enough.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Félicia Atkinson – I Don't Know, What Or Why (Mish Aaref Eish W Leish) (ft. Tamer Abu Ghazaleh)
_Sanjay_: **"**Lull yourself into a mini snooze with this dense mixture of sounds: distorted oud, flute, synths, muted percussion, recorded street bustle and a languid vocal contribution from [Tamer Abu Ghazaleh](http://www.tamer.ag/) combine to create a track rich in texture, depth and colour.**"**

## Mondkopf – The Call
_Sanjay_: **"**A meticulously arranged composition from [Christina Vantzou](http://www.christinavantzou.com/) with otherworldly drones surrounded by soft, subtle and sometimes intense veils or points in an eerie chorale intimacy. Inspired by Laurie Spiegel's 'The Expanding Universe' (1980).**"**

## Christine Ott – Tropismes
_Sanjay_: **"**'Ahwar' is a brilliant debut LP from Cairo-based musician [Nadah El Shazly](https://nadahelshazly.bandcamp.com/). Joining her are guitarist Sam Shalabi and Maurice Louca (both members of The Dwarfs Of East Agouza with Alan Bishop). On this mostly acoustic track, Nadah sings broodingly over chugging acoustic guitar chords as flutes, violins and muted percussion create a stark, unhurried and morose atmosphere.**"**

## Murcof & Vanessa Wagner – Variations For The Healing Of Arinushka
_Sanjay_: **"**This is the second album from [Jerusalem In My Heart](https://www.jerusaleminmyheart.com/), a collaborative project helmed by Radwan Ghazi Moumneh and fellow Montréal-based artist, Charles-André Coderre. Here, the slow application of delicate processing, Radwan's voice and the ringing percussion somehow feel desperately sad but never completely hopeless.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to Frédéric, Stéphane and [Oiseaux-Tempête](http://www.oiseaux-tempete.com/) for being our guest(s) today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's illustration. Have a joyous Christmas/holiday/break!</p>
