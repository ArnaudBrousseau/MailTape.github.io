<p id="introduction">This morning long-time jazz wayfarer Nick Woodmansey's [Emanative](https://emanative.bandcamp.com/) picks his three Sunday morning tunes for MailTape.</p>
<p>Three years after the brilliant [Light Years of Darkness](https://stevereidfoundation.bandcamp.com/album/the-light-years-of-the-darkness) LP on Brownswood Recordings, Emanative makes a welcome return on the self-released limited 7″, [Ominous Shanti/Black Enchantment](https://emanative.bandcamp.com/album/ominous-shanti). As usual, Nick performs with some of the finest musicians on the London scene at the moment – this time with another MailTape guest, [Sarathy Korwar](https://www.mailta.pe/249/sarathy-korwar/), as well as Tamar Osborn, Suman Joshi, Ben Hadwen, Simon Finch and Jessica Lauren.</p>

# Emanative's selection


## Maleem Mahmoud Ghania with Pharoah Sanders - Mahraba
_Emanative_: **"**Peaceful and healing trance-like music with Guembri (a Morrocan stringed and skinned bass-like instrument) percussion, chanting and Pharoah Sanders, what more do you need?**"**

## Sun Ra - Sleeping Beauty
_Emanative_: **"**I would find it impossible to pick a favourite from Sun Ra, but if I had to this might well be one of them – equally perfect for both a late night lullaby as it is for Sunday morning chilled out vibes.**"**

## Johnny Dyani Witchdoctor's Son - Magwaza
_Emanative_: **"**I'm loving any records I hear featuring South African double bassist Johnny Dyani. This Witchdoctor's Son record is an Emanative favourite. Again it is the hypnotic bass, chanting and percussion. Check also his work with Abdullah Ibrahim, Don Cherry and Turkish drummer/percussionist Okay Temiz.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Emanative - Ominous Shanti
_Sanjay_: **"**Not the first and certainly not the last, Camae is a refreshing voice in contemporary music opposing the perpetuation of injustices – the fetishisation, appropriation, distortion and profiteering of black and marginalised lives and art forms – which we who don't live them ignore.**"**

## Idris Ackamoor & The Pyramids - Rhapsody In Berlin (Part 1)
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from Berlin-based producer, [Aybee](http://deepblakmusic.com/db2/). Nicely paced for a Sunday morning – all spacious, fluid and warm synth pads.**"**

## Yazz Ahmed - Jamil Jamal
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as a spoken word artist, [Rafeef Ziadah](http://www.rafeefziadah.net/) is a Palestinian human rights activist with the Palestinian Boycott Divestment and Sanctions National Committee and Senior Campaigns Officer at the British charity War on Want. Her debut album, [Hadeel](http://www.rafeefziadah.net/hadeel/), is a rejection of the idea that art and culture can be separate from, or ‘above’, the political. I haven't stopped listening to it for ages. If you're in London, you can see her perform with Lowkey on [28th September](http://www.seetickets.com/event/lowkey-london-show-september-2017/the-coronet-theatre/1114864).**"**

## Burnt Sugar Arkestra - If There's A Hell Below
_Sanjay_: **"**Yet another of my favourite [Constellation](http://cstrecords.com/)-associated artists to feature on MailTape, [Matana](http://www.matanaroberts.com/) works in myriad contexts and mediums, including improvisation, dance, poetry and theatre. This was an idea from [Meshell Ndegeocello](http://www.meshell.com/) and Matana is joined by Jahi Lake on the drums alongside spoken word artist, Staceyann Chin, who provides the brilliant words.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today! Thanks to [Camae Ayewa](http://moormother.com/) for her cracking selections and to [Anaïs Caura](http://cargocollective.com/anaiscaura) for this episode's superb illustration.</p>
