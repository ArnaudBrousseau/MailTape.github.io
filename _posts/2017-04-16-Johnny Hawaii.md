<p id="introduction">This morning, [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyhawaiiband/ "Facebook")’s trippy selection. Johnny Hawaii's psychedelic dreamy yet energetic tracks combine cheerful indie rock with post punk influences, always feeling very sincere. </p>
<p>Open your windows, put on your sunglasses, make yourself a nice coffee, and get ready for a fulfilling day with their selection! All Sundays do not have to be lazy.</p>



# **Johnny Hawaii’s selection**

+ ## Matthewdavid - Mindflight 1
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**New Age of the New Age by Matthewdavid who runs and records for Leaving Records, best label in the world right now! Mindflight 1 is a perfect track to wake up to the world on a Sunday morning.**"**

+ ## Crystal Voyager OST - Red Sun Sea
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**This label, Anthology Recordings, dug up a bunch of soundtracks from 60's/70's/80's alternative surf movies and all of them are amazing. Here a really cool, laid-back tune from the "Crystal Voyager" OST.**"**

+ ## Spirit Club - Eye Dozer
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**Beach Boys feeling, Papapahooo's, crunchy indie rock guitars...the perfect recipe for me. See also: Jeans Wilder/ Wavves.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Johnny Hawaii - The Parrots Are Not What They Seem (They're Just Pigeons on Acid)
_Inès_: **"**2015. The South of France. Early afternoon. 25°C. Olive trees and flamingos in the background, and Johnny Hawaii playing his set at [This Is Not A Love Song](https://thisisnotalovesong.fr/ "Website") festival. Much like this memory, Johnny Hawaii's songs have this peaceful aura, like a hazy Sunday morning spent doing nothing in bed or taking a nap on a warm afternoon, pure tranquility.**"** 

+ ## Beach House - Sparks
_Inès_: **"**I think the rest of this selection can show how much I'm in need of holidays and sunshine. **"**

+ ## xX - xxx
_Inès_: **"**XXXXX**"**

+ ## The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Viholliseni Maalla
_Inès_: **"**Cute and dreamy, **"**
