<p id="introduction">This morning, [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyhawaiiband/ "Facebook")’s trippy selection. Johnny Hawaii's psychedelic surf tracks  </p>
<p>So just </p>



# **Johnny Hawaii’s selection**

+ ## Matthewdavid - Mindflight 1
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**New Age of the New Age by Matthewdavid who runs and records for Leaving Records, best label in the world right now! Mindflight 1 is a perfect track to wake up to the world on a Sunday morning.**"**

+ ## Crystal Voyager OST - Red Sun Sea
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**This label, Anthology Recordings, dug up a bunch of soundtracks from 60's/70's/80's alternative surf movies and all of them are amazing. Here is a really cool, laid-back tune from the "Crystal Voyager" OST.**"**

+ ## Spirit Club - Eye Dozer
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**Beach Boys feeling, Papapahooo's, crunchy indie rock guitars...the perfect recipe for me. See also: Jeans Wilder/ Wavves.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Johnny Hawaii - The Parrots Are Not What They Seem (They're Just Pigeons on Acid)
_Inès_: **"**2015. The South of France. Early afternoon. 25°C. Olive trees and flamingos in the background, and Johnny Hawaii playing his set at [This Is Not A Love Song](https://thisisnotalovesong.fr/ "Website") festival. Much like this memory, Johnny Hawaii's songs have this peaceful aura, like a hazy Sunday morning spent doing nothing or taking a nap on a warm afternoon, just because we have the luxury to do so. Pure, unaltered tranquility.**"** 

+ ## The Radio Dept. - It's Personal
_Inès_: **"**Okay so now we're traveling to a colder country thanks to The Radio Dept.'s, a Swedish band, "It's Personal". I have always enjoyed this cold and dreamy vibe that can be found across their tracks, and this one is one my favorites. The way it builds up, mixing some kind of sadness with optimism, every detail of the song becoming more and more intese... Kind of feels cathartic, an amazing song for long walks when you need to figure out things i guess.  **"**

+ ## Beach House - Sparks
_Inès_: **"**I have been listening for this song on repeat for the last few days/weeks. It has this quiet optimism, feels like  **"**

+ ## The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Viholliseni Maalla
_Inès_: **"**I know there is no need to present the BJM, and this song taken from "Aufheben" is really nice. Sung in Finnish, it just feels like a warm blanket **"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/johnnyhawaiiband/ "Facebook") for his participation, and Anais for the illustration. Have a lazy Eastern Sunday, and enjoy the fact that your weekend won't be over so soon. </p>
