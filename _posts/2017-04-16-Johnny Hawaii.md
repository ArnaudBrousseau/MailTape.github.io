<p id="introduction">This morning, [Johnny Hawaii](https://www.facebook.com/cutoffyourhands/ "Facebook")’s trippy selection. Johnny Hawaii's psychedelic dreamy yet energetic tracks combine cheerful indie rock with post punk influences, always feeling very sincere. </p>
<p>Open your windows, put on your sunglasses, make yourself a nice coffee, and get ready for a fulfilling day with their selection! All Sundays do not have to be lazy.</p>



# **Johnny Hawaii’s selection**

+ ## Matthewdavid - Mindflight 1
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**New Age of the New Age by Matthewdavid who runs and records for Leaving Records, best label in the world right now! Mindflight 1 is a perfect track to wake up to the world on a Sunday morning.**"**

+ ## Crystal Voyager OST - Red Sun Sea
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**This label, Anthology Recordings, dug up a bunch of soundtracks from 60's/70's/80's alternative surf movies and all of them are amazing. Here a really cool, laid-back tune from the "Crystal Voyager" OST.**"**

+ ## Spirit Club - Eye Dozer
_Johnny Hawaii_: **"**Beach Boys feeling, Papapahooo's, crunchy indie rock guitars...the perfect recipe for me. See also: Jeans Wilder/ Wavves.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Cut Off Your Hands - Higher Lows and Lower Highs
_Inès_: **"**After a few years without any releases, Cut Off Your Hands decided to gift us with two new songs, and I couldn’t be happier about it since it is a band I have been listening to for years. « Higher Lows and Lower Highs » is one of them, referring to mental health issues and their impact on life yet having this funky, upbeat sound that is so difficult to resist.**"** 

+ ## BABE - Scooping Pints
_Inès_: **"**Let's continue in this groovy vibe with BABE's song, making us travel to a tropical island, under a blazing sun, chilling and/or dancing, simply enjoying life.**"**

+ ## Aquaserge - Tour du Monde
_Inès_: **"**Aquaserge is a French band mixing so many influences it’s hard to explain the kind of music they’re playing. « Tour du monde », taken from their latest release « Laisse ça être », feels like listening to a conversation between all its instruments. Who’s going to have the final say in this?**"**

+ ## Caandides - Rio
_Inès_: **"**« Rio » is my go-to song every time a ray of sunshine appears for more than two seconds. I love its structure, alternating turbulent moments with calmer ones, letting you breathe in between. It just overall feels carefree and optimistic, perfect for busy sunny days!**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Cut Off Your Hands](https://www.facebook.com/cutoffyourhands/ "Facebook") for their participation, and Anais for the illustration. Have a delightful Sunday! </p>
