## Skalpel - Sculpture
Crackazat: **"**_A great wake up track, taken from on of my favorite trip-hop/nu-Jazz albums. The rest of the album fantastic. It's simply self titled 'Skalpel' and was released on 2004 on ninja tune._**â€œ**
 
## Sameed - Blue
C.: **"**_Like myself, DJ/Producer Sameed has released music on swedish house label 'Local Talk'. "Blue" is a blissful and soothing piece of house music, with a supremely soulful feeling. It's gorgeously musical and I love the harmony. _**"**
 
## Type Sun - The PL
C.: **"**_Types sun is truly original producer and musician, who through years of dedication and craftsmanship, has created some truly timeless songwriting and productions. 'The PL' was first released over 8 years ago, and still fills me with the same joy and excitement to this day. It is an eternal piece of soul music._**"**
