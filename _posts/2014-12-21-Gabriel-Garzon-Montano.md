<p id="introduction">
This morning, please welcome our new delighted guest who is half Colombian and half French but born and brought up in Brooklyn. [Gabriel Garzon Montano](http://www.gabrielgarzonmontano.com/) is a true child of the world. </p>

# French Colombian American
That’s the blend for his classy vibes where silence is as important as melody and although the groove is cold his voice is as warm as South America. Let’s listen to his handpicked selection where he draws his influence from three diverse cultures.

# His selection for a classy morning

## Quincy Vidal - Check
_Gabriel:_ **"**I love this woman with my heart and soul. Listen up. Tough and delicate. This is my shit!**"**

## Sage Caswell - Whatever Forever
_Gabriel:_ **"**Dark funky house vibes on this one. Sage Caswell and Archie Pelago man... goldmines.**"**

## How Bout Now - Drake
_Gabriel:_ **"**Love the sample (although I had never heard the original not gonna front) and the nostalgic feeling of that diminished chord moving up to the minor. That move gets me every time. Lyrics are perfect. Love me a song about underdog days haha. Motivational and soulful music.**"**
