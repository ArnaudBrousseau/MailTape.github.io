##  Black Sabbath - Planet Caravan
Miel de Montagne: **"**I was 13, something like that, my skate times listening to heavy guitars. one day my dad came to me and said: go check out Jimi Hendrix but most important go check out Black Sabbath. I loved it, and when I discovered this song I was blown, hopping it will never stop.**"**

##  Santo & Jhonny - Sleep Walk
