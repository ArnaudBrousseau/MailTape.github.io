# **Dan Rico's selection**

+ ## Whitney - No Woman
_Dan_: **"** This track struck a strong chord with me the first time I heard it. I love the soothing/ambitious production using horns and strings. Brings to mind reminisces of road lust, wind dancing through fields of corn, reflections against car windows as the night cruises by--Prompts the coexistent feelings- loneliness and independence-- inspired by long, weary travels. **"**

+ ## Omni - Wire
_Dan_: **"**Out of high school I went through an intense Josef K phase. These guys are the answer to my post-punk prayers. Tight, angular guitar riffs interplayed with resolute, methodical bass lines and minimal, groovy drumming. On top of it a nonchalant croon reminiscent of the early days of the Strokes. There's something almost robotic about the character of this song until it breaks into the disco-punk chorus. And then your heart melts just a little. **"**

+ ## NoName - Diddy Bop (ft. Raury &Cam O'bi)
_Dan_: **"** This track takes me back to childhood summers in 90's Chicago. Extended stays with cousins, the "it takes a village" vibe of being raised and growing up. That and you can dance to it. There's been so much exciting hip hop coming out of Chicago lately and this is just one of many tracks you just hear and suddenly you think "Damn.. so good. **"**
