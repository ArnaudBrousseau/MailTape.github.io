# **Dan Rico's selection**

+ ## Whitney - No Woman
_Dan_: **"** This track struck a strong chord with me the first time I heard it. I love the soothing/ambitious production using horns and strings. Brings to mind reminisces of road lust, wind dancing through fields of corn, reflections against car windows as the night cruises by--Prompts the coexistent feelings- loneliness and independence-- inspired by long, weary travels. **"**

+ ## Omni - Wire
_Dan_: **"**Out of high school I went through an intense Josef K phase. These guys are the answer to my post-punk prayers. Tight, angular guitar riffs interplayed with resolute, methodical bass lines and minimal, groovy drumming. On top of it a nonchalant croon reminiscent of the early days of the Strokes. There's something almost robotic about the character of this song until it breaks into the disco-punk chorus. And then your heart melts just a little. **"**

+ ## NoName - Diddy Bop (ft. Raury &Cam O'bi)
_Dan_: **"** This track takes me back to childhood summers in 90's Chicago. Extended stays with cousins, the "it takes a village" vibe of being raised and growing up. That and you can dance to it. There's been so much exciting hip hop coming out of Chicago lately and this is just one of many tracks you just hear and suddenly you think "Damn.. so good. **"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Dan Rico - Nujah
_Louise_: **"**Shaelone's work catch me the first time I listened to it. The track was "Just Solar" and its name echoed in me. Then I took the time to listen to the rest of the tracks and I was caught in its web.**"**

+ ## Skence - Anna
_Louise_: **"**Skence is another French producer that I really appreciate. He has a peculiar touch in his beats. He intertwines a variety of samples, some old French songs and some organic sounds. _Anna_ is the smoothest track, just what you need on a Sunday.**"**

+ ## Jack J - Something on my mind
_Louise_: **"**Risk taking this track. 10 minutes of pure house and groove. The saxophone that comes in, I didn't see it coming. _Something on my mind_ takes me up, up in the sky.**"**

+ ## GoldLink - Rough Soul (YUNG BAE Family Cookout Version)
_Louise_: **"** YUNG BAE still got be with his groovy edits. Also, I love the accents of GoldLink's rappers/singers so I'm sold. **"**
