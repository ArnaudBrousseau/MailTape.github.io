<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# **Mélanie Pain's selection**

+ ## Tortoise & Bonnie 'Prince' Billy - Thunder road
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**Amazing cover of  Bruce Springsteen with the noisy sound of Tortoise and the pristine voice of  Bonnie Prince Billy. A bizarre and powerfull mix that works really well. Springsteen lyrics are wonderfull. **"**

+ ## Iron & wine - A boy with a coin
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**A classic Iron and Wine song that is soft and strong, a beautifil folk ritournelle that sticks in your head for days. Love the rythm of that song. 
**"**

+ ## Team Ghost - The Riser
_Mélanie Pain_: **"**it's dark, melancholic, electro, noisy, it's like a soundtrack for the end of the world or for it's beginning... I can't wait to hear the new album of Team Ghost**"**
