# Jally Kebba Susso's selection


## Ballaké Sissoko & Vincent Ségal – Chamber Music
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**This song is really evocative to me. It reminds me of growing up in Gambia. When the elders are sitting down at night time doing their sumuog, when they gather together to play music and have conversations. Depending on who was around you’d hear the balaphon and kora played. It’s a soothing song. Soothing and emotional.**"**

## Soriba Kouyaté – Kanakassi
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**Just beautiful. THIS is the definition of beauty. And this song is one of my biggest inspirations. Even when I am angry, I can listen to this song and it calms me right down… Soriba was light-years ahead of his time in terms of his versatility and innovation. I learnt a lot from him. But he is no more now. He passed away… It is unique song. It can always take you on a journey.**"**

## James Brown – This is a Man’s World
_Jally Kebba Susso_: **"**James Brown, man. The technicality of how he puts his music together—the instrumentation—is something that is beyond expression. I can just feel it. It is unfiltered. Straight from his heart. When you listen to it it touches you straight. His music has opened lots of doors for me, inspirationally. The music has lots of elements that to me represent different things. It is very colourful. It feels like it is going to go somewhere, in a different direction, but it keeps you right there... in a great way.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jally Kebba Susso – Ajama
_Sanjay_: **"**Fresh from the presses, this latest track from [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/) is a collaboration with LA-based singer, [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/). Uplifting and melodic sounds for this morning 'hoping to induce positive energy around you and exhilarate your soul'.**"**

## Faith Mussa – Mdidi
_Sanjay_: **"**I saw [Faith Mussa](http://faithmussa.com/) supporting Jally Kebba Susso at [Dalston Curve Garden](http://dalstongarden.org/) in London earlier this month, and he played with such a captivating energy. His one man band act is impressive and anyone who thinks Ed Sheeran can do some good loops should see Mussa show how it’s really done.**"**

##  Miriam Makeba – Liwawechi
_Sanjay_: **"**[Dualist Inquiry](https://soundcloud.com/dualistinquiry) is the solo electronic dance project of Sahej Bakshi, a producer, guitarist and composer based in New Delhi. This track is a blissful blend of guitar and downtempo electro beats from his 2013 album, Doppelgänger. The use of synth bass and conga drums transforms my surroundings into a pretty calm environment.**"**

## Sona Jobarteh – Saya
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as utilising polyrhythmic patterns, Amy Garapic, Carson Moody and Matt Evans of [Tigue](http://tiguemusic.com/) continuously swap instrument duties, building their sound by incorporating melodicas, gongs, maracas, and tambourines. The trio patiently build small compositions into larger sounding creations to the point where the listener forgets they’re still only hearing three people performing simultaneously.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jally Kebba Susso](http://jallykebbasusso.com/), and to [Anaïs Caura](https://vimeo.com/anaismarthecaura) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
