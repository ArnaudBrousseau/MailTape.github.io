Tamino - Habibi
Soft and deep, this track stuns us everytime. Sunday morning at the break of dawn, with a delightful coffe, you will be rocked by this wonderful voice.

Orange Blossom - Maria. 
This duo always surprises us. This time they went to Egypt to offer us a music that mixes Pink Floyd, Oum Khaltoum and Joy Division. We love this refreshing blend of oriental melodies and electronic music.

Fela Kuti - Trouble Sleep Yanga Wake Am
Known as the Black President, Fela Kuti uses music as weapon against the dictatorship in his country. This is also how we feel music. It's a powerful way to bring people together. This track gives us the energy to continue our dream : offering people good vibes by mixing different musical cultures.
