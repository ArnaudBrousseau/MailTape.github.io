# His morning selection

## Taylor McFerrin – Decisions (feat. Emily King)
_B.Lewis:_ **"**I’ve been extremely stuck on this record since it came out. Atmospheric and cohesive, the melody easily carries you on generous morning music high.**"**

## Musiq Soulchild – Just Friends
_B.Lewis:_ **"**For me, this song is a classic, wake up and get your day started on the right foot type of track. The uplifting, teetering borderline gospel feel, is sometimes just what I need to get my days started.**"**

## Toro Y Moi - So Many Details
_B.Lewis:_ **"**One of the many favorites off of his album “Anything in Return”, curated by the masterful Toro Y Moi. Something moody I can nod my head to while brushing my teeth.**"**
