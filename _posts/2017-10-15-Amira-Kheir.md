<p id="introduction">Described by Songlines magazine as ‘bold and poetic… beautiful and fearless', we are delighted to share vocalist [Amira Kheir's](http://amirakheir.com/) Sunday morning listening for MailTape.</p>
<p>She has toured internationally and recorded with Django Bates and StoRMChaser. She also plays with [London Improvisers Orchestra](http://www.londonimprovisersorchestra.co.uk/) and is a leader and side-woman of several other ensembles – including her latest trio, Julie Kjær 3, with bass player John Edwards and drummer Steve Noble. Their debut album ‘[Dobbeltgænger](https://cleanfeed-records.com/product/dobbeltgaeenger/)’ was released in March last year on Lisbon's Clean Feed Records.</p>


# Amira Kheir's selection


## Sarah Vaughan - All of Me
_Amira Kheir_: **"**Needless to say, she's at the very top of my pyramid of wonderful vocalists of our time. I can listen to her any time, any day of the week. In this song especially, I love her playfulness and the feel she creates with her trio is just perfect. This totally sets the mood for my Sunday morning.**"**

## Ali Farka Touré & Ry Cooder - Gomni
_Amira Kheir_: **"**Collaborations of this kind are really hard to get right, but this one has created one of my favourite albums. What I love about this song, is the effortlessness. Both musicians leave so much space for one another and there is just no rush to get going. The communication is so natural and that's what allows the spirit of the song to be conjured. It's timeless - and I love getting in the zone with this on lazy Sunday mornings.**"**

## A Tribe Called Quest - We Can Get Down
_Amira Kheir_: **"**No Sunday morning playlist of mine would be complete without A Tribe Called Quest! I'm a child of the 80s, so 90s hiphop is part of the soundtrack to my childhood. In fact this is most of what I listen to on those Sundays when I'm able to start the day nice and slow, and it accompanies me throughout the day if I'm doing chores or lazing around with friends. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Amira Kheir — Habibi Ta'al
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from 2009 with Julie Kjær performing alongside Kasper Bjerg, Thomas Sejthen and Søren Mehlsen as the Julie Kjær Kvartet. Less bold and provocative than the brilliant [Dobbeltgænger](https://cleanfeed-records.com/product/dobbeltgaeenger/) released last year, this ranges from loosely expressive to melodically safe. Perfect for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Arooj Aftab - Mohabbat (Live in Berlin)
_Sanjay_: **"**In collaboration with the [BBC Concert Orchestra](https://www.bbc.co.uk/concertorchestra), [Trish Clowes](http://trishclowes.com/) weaves smoothly around the strings with some intuitive interplay with fellow collaborator, [Gwilym Simcock](http://gwilymsimcock.com/). A sensitively-balanced and dreamy tune for a Sunday morning with some nice orchestral arrangements reminiscent of Claus Ogerman.**"**

## Susheela Raman — Vinayaka
_Sanjay_: **"**Moving eloquently between composition and improvisation, [Hear in Now](http://www.hearinnow.com/) are violinst Mazz Swift, cellist Tomeka Reid and bassist Silvia Bolognesi. A short and sharp burst of lyrical and soaring violin, amid a searching bass and an abstracted counterpoint of the cello.**"**

## Lhasa De Sela — Rising
_Sanjay_: **"**And we close this morning's tape with a beautiful piece taken from a piano duets album to support the solidarity campaign for [Abousfian Abdelrazik](http://www.peoplescommission.org/en/abdelrazik/) in Montréal.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks for listening and much gratitude and thanks to [Julie Kjær](https://juliekjaer.com/) for being our guest this morning, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's beautiful illustration!</p>
