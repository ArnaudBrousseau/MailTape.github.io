# Mind design...

As a conscious being often too aware of the subtle activities of the brain, getting bad news can be a brain challenge.

But, when your friend presents you with a guest as divine as MNDSGN or ‘mind design’, you can’t help but to perceive this as a sign. MNDSGN will gently rewire your brain cells for utopia.

Leaving no one astray, his music will release all natural brain chemicals and induce you in a state of dust and nirvana. This should be technically illegal, as I have just hit the repeat button unconsciously about ten times. Aimlessly trying to get to where I am to where I am going, without a final destination. Did I just go somewhere ? 

Doesn’t seem so, as I am bluffed by the silence of the I that forgets it all and just continues. And if certain shadows linger in your presence this morning, the rest of this MailTape, will give you a burst of lyrics infused with honesty and pulsating rhythms whispering ; just come to me now, as the ascension is mieux que tout.


# **MNDSGN's Selection**

## Peter Collins - Happily by Brikliam Jehreeus (acoustic version)
_MNDSGN_: **"**This is a cover of a cover of a song originally by brik.liam called Happily. This one's been in rotation & is definitely on a sunday morning tip. It's crazy how different it sounds from the OG. Been a fan of this guys stuff lately. Shoutout to my dude Kiefer for putting me on. Most of the stuff on this guys soundcloud are raw voice memos. Crazy vocal control...**"**

## Kiefer - Tubesocks
_MNDSGN_: **"**Speakin of Kiefer, I decided to include a track of his called tubesocks. Not only do I wear tubesocks pretty often, I also heavily dig the piano arrangement on this tune. Imagine the clouds opening up to reveal the heavens. Greatjob Kiefer.**"**

## Maryn E. Coote - One Who Cares
_MNDSGN_: **"**This downtempo 80s cut sounds like it must've been a demo. The way its recorded/mixed is super raw. This is such a good one to let play all the way out. Lovely arrangements/songwriting. Not sure if it was ever properly released. Actually none of these three songs are properly released. Haha. Cheers.**"**
