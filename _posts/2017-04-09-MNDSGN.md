# **MNDSGN's Selection**

## Peter Collins - Happily by Brikliam Jehreeus (acoustic version)
_MNDSGN_: **"**This is a cover of a cover of a song originally by brik.liam called Happily. This one's been in rotation & is definitely on a sunday morning tip. It's crazy how different it sounds from the OG. Been a fan of this guys stuff lately. Shoutout to my dude Kiefer for putting me on. Most of the stuff on this guys soundcloud are raw voice memos. Crazy vocal control...**"**

## Kiefer - Tubesocks
_MNDSGN_: **"**Speakin of Kiefer, I decided to include a track of his called tubesocks. Not only do I wear tubesocks pretty often, I also heavily dig the piano arrangement on this tune. Imagine the clouds opening up to reveal the heavens. Greatjob Kiefer.**"**

## Maryn E. Coote - One Who Cares
_MNDSGN_: **"**This downtempo 80s cut sounds like it must've been a demo. The way its recorded/mixed is super raw. This is such a good one to let play all the way out. Lovely arrangements/songwriting. Not sure if it was ever properly released. Actually none of these three songs are properly released. Haha. Cheers.**"**
