<p id="introduction">This is the introduction oh yeah</p>



# **MNDSGN's Selection**

## Peter Collins - Happily by Brikliam Jehreeus (acoustic version)
_MNDSGN_: **"**This is a cover of a cover of a song originally by brik.liam called Happily. This one's been in rotation & is definitely on a sunday morning tip. It's crazy how different it sounds from the OG. Been a fan of this guys stuff lately. Shoutout to my dude Kiefer for putting me on. Most of the stuff on this guys soundcloud are raw voice memos. Crazy vocal control...**"**

## Kiefer - Tubesocks
_MNDSGN_: **"**Speakin of Kiefer, I decided to include a track of his called tubesocks. Not only do I wear tubesocks pretty often, I also heavily dig the piano arrangement on this tune. Imagine the clouds opening up to reveal the heavens. Greatjob Kiefer.**"**

## Maryn E. Coote - One Who Cares
_MNDSGN_: **"**This downtempo 80s cut sounds like it must've been a demo. The way its recorded/mixed is super raw. This is such a good one to let play all the way out. Lovely arrangements/songwriting. Not sure if it was ever properly released. Actually none of these three songs are properly released. Haha. Cheers.**"**


# MailTape's Selection

+ ## Fond of Tigers - Vitamin Meathawk (feat. Sandro Perri)
_Sanjay_: **"**I first saw Fond of Tigers at 1067 in Vancouver back in 2008. Three albums and eight years later, they returned in late 2016 with [Uninhabit](https://fondoftigers.bandcamp.com/album/uninhabit). Lots more syncopated drums, contrapuntal melodies and carefree abandon...while keeping the groove firmly in the pocket. Vitamin Meathawk explored new territory for the group, on which Toronto's [Sandro Perri](http://www.sandroperri.com/) adds his brand of gentle, husky vocals.**"** 

+ ## Martin Arnold - The Coo-Coo Bird
_Sanjay_: **"**I'm a newcomer to composer Martin Arnold and much of [Arraymusic](http://www.arraymusic.com/)'s output. I love the strange friction between the open, plangent quality of the singing here, and the weblike instrumental work from Callum McSherry, the Quatuor Bozzini quartet and University of Bristol New Music Ensemble.**"**

+ ## Saltland - Magnolia
_Sanjay_: **"**The music of [Saltland](http://www.saltland.ca/)/[Rebecca Foon](http://www.rebeccafoon.com/)/[Esmerine](http://www.esmerine.com/) is to me what Efterklang is to Stephen: music capabale of articulating a forlorn yet rousing sense of hope. Magnolia is from Saltland's latest release (just last week), _A Common Truth_, on Montréal's delightfully irrepresible [Constellation Records](http://cstrecords.com/).**"**

+ ## Esmerine - The Neighbourhoods Rise
_Sanjay_: **"**Ending with yet more hope. Most fans of [Esmerine](http://www.esmerine.com/) will be acquainted with the characteristically morose, sparse and tranquil violin sounds that give way to the rumble and swell of drums and bass and explosive guitar peaks. But it doesn’t make it any less enjoyable here.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s it for today! Thanks to Stephen Lyons and [Fond of Tigers](http://www.fondoftigers.com/) for his and their participation, and [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for the illustration. Have a hopeful Sunday!</p>
