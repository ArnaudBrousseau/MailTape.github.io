# Nicolas Michaux's selection:

## Andy Shauf - The Magician
_Nicolas Michaux_: **"**Crafted, roots and elegant. There's a sheer love of sound in andy shauf's work - obviously a very talented songwriter.**"** 

## Octav - Man from the Stars
_N.M._: **"**To continue in psychedelic mood I'll listen this one to fly away upon earth. But still in my super-hero suit.**"**

## Bengale - Je Danse le Mia (I Am Cover)
_N.M._: **"**To conclude, down to earth, I propose a great cover of I Am "Je Danse le Mia" by Bengale. It'll give you the strengh to endure your sunday brunch in a wood with a book and ... a nice girl. Or a guy, as you want, but it'll be less romantic.**"**
