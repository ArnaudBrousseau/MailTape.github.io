## Nicolas Michaux's selection:

• **Andy Shauf - The Magician**
Nicolas Michaux: "Crafted, roots and elegant. There's a sheer love of sound in andy shauf's work - obviously a very talented songwriter."

• **Soft Hair - Lying Has to Stop**
N.M. : **"**Amazing track. Smooth and sexy. It's also my tour crew's absolute favorite video at the moment.  **"**

• **Robbing Millions - 8 is the Figure that I Like the Most**
N.M. : **"**One of the coolest bands of the Brussels scene. I saw them live a few days ago - terrific show. This song will stay with you for days...**"**


# • Nicolas Michaux - A la Vie, à la Mort
Maxime: **"** There is the instrumental, soft, naïve, crescendo, eclectic, directly imported from the eigties, from France or Italy. And there are the lyrics, and the voice of Nicolas Michaux. I allways liked falsely naives lyrics. This one is a perfect melcolic love song. "Whatever Works !" seems to say Nicolas, If it goes wrong, or right, what's happen is printed into our personnal history. So, whatever works ! **"**


## Mailtape's selection

• **Alex Cameron - Mongrel**
Maxime: I suspect Alex Cameron to be nuts. Between two guy, equaly talented, there is a nut, and a regular one. Nut's music always surpass regular guy's music. It's just a theory. Just look about Mac Demarco. Right ? 

• **I Have a Tribe - After We Meet**
### M.: A Piano / Voice balade like there is few of them now. Last year Tobias Jesso Jr. tried to resurrected this style of composing. I Have a Tribe always succed to compose them too. Look out his first album, it'll be you're best winter's companion.

• **Weekend Affair - Duel Part. 2**
###
M.: A Pop song to conclude. Out from Yuksek's label before summer 2016, i've just discover Weekend Affair. Or, RE-discover, becouse the band used to sing in English before there last EP, where Duel Part. 2 is come from, and it's a done deal ! I hope there'll we choose to continue to sing in French. 

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to Nicolas Michaux for his selection. I invite you to buy his first album ! We hope you enjoyed this episode. Have a nice day Folks!</p>
