# Title 



# Talitres's selection:

## Mark Kozelek & Jimmy Lavalle - By The Time That I Awoke
_Talitres_: **"**Early 90's I was fascinated by the slow core scene of the west coast: American Music Club, Idaho, Swell, Red House Painters, and many more... Mark Kozelek, founding members of Red House Painters remained very prolific, with a real artistic integrity. What a beauty, suspended, timeless, a real gem, it's remarkable. And a sweet thing to wake up to on a Sunday.**"**

## Sufjan Stevens - Should Have Known Better
_Talitres_: **"**Steven Sufjan is a real treasure from all points of view: outstanding releases, relevant collaborations, new challenges...and above all his music. "_Carrie & Lowell_" is a tender, touching and poignant album and above all disarmingly appealing.**"**

## Le Loup - Morning Song
_Talitres_: **"**Le Loup was an American indie band founded in Washington, D.C. by Sam Simkoff and with their bandmates they did a harmonious family. Fleet Foxes-style, Appalachian sounds, hymnal harmonies, and avant garde leanings. We love that freedom, that freshness, their sweet experimentation.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Sean Bouchard, manager of Talitres Records](https://www.facebook.com/talitres/) for his selection. Good Sunday everyone!</p>
