# Sheep, Dog and Wolf's morning inspiration

## Baths - Ironworks
_SDW:_ **"**I can't even describe how much I love Baths. I discovered him with his debut, Cerulean, which came out quite a while ago now. It's full of gorgeous, joyous tracks, and it was like nothing I'd ever heard before! His follow-up, Obsidian, which this track is from, was quite a change in direction; much darker, more introspective. Most of the album is very, very intense, at times deeply depressive and at others raw and abrasive - this track is one of the more relaxed ones however, and I just bliss out every time I hear it.**"**
 
## Ghoul - Swimming Pool (Seekae remix)
_SDW:_ **"**This Ghoul is not the Ghoul you may be thinking of! Many times I've searched for a track by this Ghoul and come up with something from the death metal band of the same name. This Ghoul is not death metal at all; they were a Sydney band (sadly now disbanded) that made weird and wonderful music that is near impossible to describe. Give their mini-LP Dunks a listen, it is amazing! The vocal style is completely unique, and absolutely captivating.
This particular track is a remix by Seekae, and it's brilliant.**"**
 
## Lontalius - yr heart is beating
_SDW:_ **"**Lontalius, a.k.a. Eddie Johnston, is a 17-year-old musical prodigy from Wellington, New Zealand. Being Wellington-based myself, I am lucky enough to be able to work with him, and he is a truly inspirational guy! This track is just so perfect, short and sweet, heartbreaking, and absolutely beautiful. After you listen to this, go and listen to everything else he has ever released, it is all amazing.**"**
