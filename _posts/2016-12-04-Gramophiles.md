<p id="introduction"> This morning, xxx </p>

# **Dan Rico's selection**

+ ## Velvet Slide - Stoop Kids

_Gramophiles_: **"** We are always on the look that kind of groovy hip-hop !  New-Orleans based Stoop Kids are making it sounds raw with the perfect touch of romance ! **"**

+ ## iZem - Agua Viva
_Gramophiles_: **"**The french « beat raconteur » based in Lisbon just delivered a very promessing LP called Hafa signed on Soudway Records…and we really love that multi-influenced new kind ! **"**

+ ## Peter Power - Sun Sun Damba
_Gramophiles_: **"** The eccentric Peter Power is always up for a little boom!
The captivating Sun Sun Damba puts us into orbit and we want more ... **"**

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## Dan Rico - Soft Feeling
_Maxime_: **"**This is the intro of the Dan Rico's album. It's a good front door for his music. As a vintage grunge crooners, Rico let us dive in his welcoming universe. "Soft Feeling" is a lazy garage-pop anthem for all the lost romantics, who try to survive in a world that do not like them anymore.**"**

+ ## Alex Izenberg - Grace
_Maxime_: **"**"Grace" is a timeless ballad. It seems to be filtered by the entire twentieth century. This little californian slacker boy remind me Randy Newman. But a melancholy Randy.**"**

+ ## Chain Wallet - Shade
_Maxime_: **"**It getting could out there. This song is the perfect accessory to walk into the freezed air, hands warm in your pocket. Weirdly, this band come from Norway... They know what they talking about. Sometime it'll look like cold wave, sometimes it definitly is a pure gold-pop song, it depends your mood. **"**

+ ## Kevin Morby - Beautiful Strangers
_Maxime_: **"**This one is a must-listen song. We already know that Kevin Morby is the little prince of american ballad song. This one look like an old and good Bob Dylan song. I assume the comparaison. It's a strong protest song, but formally soft in the ears. Words of Morby will be stuck in your head for a long time. **"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all Folks! Thanks to Dan Rico for his selection and thanks to you for listening and follow us every Sunday morning. LOVE !</p>
