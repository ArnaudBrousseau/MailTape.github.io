<p id="introduction">This Sunday morning we are delighted to welcome harpist [Mary Lattimore](http://marylattimoreharpist.tumblr.com/) to MailTape. By now I've forgotten the summer. I don’t remember what the morning is. It has merged into a fading white light, when that morning has awakened and too quickly ceased. Mary's own sound on her latest album, [Hundreds of Days](https://marylattimoreharpist.bandcamp.com/album/hundreds-of-days), as well as her selections this morning capture this feeling plainly.
<br><br>
If you're in London Mary will be playing live with Lucinda Chua in support at [The Lexington](http://thelexington.co.uk/event.php?id=315) on Monday 19th November. She'll also be supporting Kurt Vile alongside Meg Baird at the O2 Empire Shepherds Bush on Tuesday 6th and Wednesday 7th November.</p>


# Mary Lattimore's selection

## Brian Eno – Fullness of Wind
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**I like the idea of listening to classical music on a Sunday morning and I love this morphed version of the Canon in D, which I've played millions of times before at weddings. It's real weird to my ears, and totally luxurious and beautiful.**"**

## Henryk Górecki - Third Symphony Movement 3
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**This one is pretty heavy and gorgeous and makes your heart feel something. I can see it being really luminous and not as sorrowful on a Sunday morning as late on a Saturday night. You can design your own context for such a glowing thing, sometimes. **"**

##  Baird Sisters – Tracks
_Mary Lattimore_: **"**[The Baird sisters](http://www.thebairdsisters.com/), Meg and Laura, are both super musicians on their own, but combined, their sister-harmonies and sister-instincts are clear and fun to admire. I love this song. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Mary Lattimore - Hello From the Edge of the Earth
_Sanjay_: **"**Taken from Mary Lattimore's latest LP, [Hundreds of Days](https://marylattimoreharpist.bandcamp.com/album/hundreds-of-days), this track conjures up positive connotations of the natural world for me. It’s instantly soothing and hushed—an inviting glassy rush of synth pads and strings. Subtle and hymn-like.**"**

## Áine O'Dwyer – Tremor
_Sanjay_: **"**A muted piano improvisation from another harpist, [Áine O'Dwyer](https://soundcloud.com/aine-o-dwyer). Listening to it makes everything slow down for me. In her own words, "it still sits in my parents' sitting room and each time I visit them, I spend some time catching up with my old friend".**"**

## Orla Wren – The Cup Of Remembered Things (w/ Aaron Martin & Isnaj Dui)
_Inès_: **"**Included as the bonus track on [The Blizzard That Birthed Her](https://aaronmartin.bandcamp.com/album/the-blizzard-that-birthed-her), 'The Cup Of Remembered Things' uses eerie found sounds and the occasional ethereal vocal sample to a calming effect.**"**

## United Bible Studies – Hazlehurst Requiem
_Inès_: **"**I wanted to mirror Jerry Paper's last pick with a kind of similar one. I've inadvertently liked a few Avventur songs before realising that they were from the same artist. I honestly wouldn't be able to describe what their music is. It's cool. This track feels like moving forward when facing super strong winds.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As alwaysn thanks so much for listening! Big love to [Jerry Paper](https://jerrypaper.bandcamp.com/) for his great selection, and to [Camille Céléstin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for the amazing illustration! Have a colourful Sunday!</p>
