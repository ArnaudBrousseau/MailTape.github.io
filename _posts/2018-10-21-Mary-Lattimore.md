<p id="introduction">This morning, please welcome [Jerry Paper](https://jerrypaper.bandcamp.com/)'s eclectic selection. Jerry Paper is Lucas Nathan, an American artist from Los Angeles. Jerry Paper's music is multi-faceted: quirky, cartoonish, dystopian, out-of-this-world, melancholic, ironic. It's witty and stays graceful at all times. Jerry Paper released his latest album two days ago, [check it out](https://www.stonesthrow.com/store/album/jerrypaper/like-a-baby). 
<br><br>
This morning, things are soft, chill, funny and deconstructed. Are you ready to enter Jerry Paper’s musical multiverse? Hope you'll enjoy the trip.</p>


# Jerry Paper's selection

## Matty - Every Moment I Live To Come
_Jerry Paper_: **"**Matty Tavares makes very excellent music outside of his role as piano man in [Badbadnotgood](https://www.mailta.pe/110/bbng/), and he helped produce my upcoming LP. Here he embodies 90s chill-groove in his own unique way and I think it's a nice mellow way to start the day.**"**

## Noah Wall - [John Cage Laughing](https://soundcloud.com/noahwall/john-cage-laughing)
_Jerry Paper_: **"**Noah Wall is one of the most interesting and excellent people I've had the pleasure of being friends with. When I lived in New York we had a club called the Nacho Research Center where we would investigate the limits of the definition of "nacho", which often means translating non-nacho dishes into nacho form. The epitome of this is Noah's Shrimp Scampi Nachos. Anyway, I love him dearly, and equally love his sonic experiments. I considered putting his field recordings of Guitar Center here (just as hectic and insane as you would imagine) but figured there could be no better way to start a Sunday morning than listening to a roughly 40 minute string of samples of John Cage laughing.**"**

## Macula Dog - I Make Lake
_Jerry Paper_: **"**Macula Dog is quite possibly my favorite current band. This song is the manifestation of your Sunday morning hangover. Enjoy.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Jerry Paper - Halfway Zen
_Inès_: **"**Jerry Paper is... versatility. I’ve actually discovered him with MailTape (thanks [Aldous RH](https://www.mailta.pe/274/aldous-rh/) and [Hector Gachan](https://www.mailta.pe/289/hector-gachan/)!) and I’ve been impressed by the different musical genres he takes on while maintaining his identity. But the thing I love the most in his music is its realness. His lyrics are smart, honest, and he knows how to sing about feelings without making it too whiny or awkward. His music is a gentle reminder that life is absurd and that nothing really matters (but in a good way).**"**

## yungatita - Bedroom
_Inès_: **"**It has been a while since I’ve listened to a song on repeat. This song is so filling, so calming, so dreamy. Hazes of pastel blue and pink and yellow. A spring Sunday morning surrounded by cherry blossoms.**"**

## Ross From Friends - John Cage
_Inès_: **"**Alright, another John Cage themed song. Extremely chill song turning out a bit more nightmarish at the end. It layers out so nicely though. Plus, seagull sounds are always nice to hear.**"**

## Avventur - Lise
_Inès_: **"**I wanted to mirror Jerry Paper's last pick with a kind of similar one. I've inadvertently liked a few Avventur songs before realising that they were from the same artist. I honestly wouldn't be able to describe what their music is. It's cool. This track feels like moving forward when facing super strong winds.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As alwaysn thanks so much for listening! Big love to [Jerry Paper](https://jerrypaper.bandcamp.com/) for his great selection, and to [Camille Céléstin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for the amazing illustration! Have a colourful Sunday!</p>
