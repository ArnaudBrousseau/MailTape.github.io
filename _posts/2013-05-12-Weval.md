<p id="introduction">This morning is sunnier than ever. Nights are getting shorter and parties longer. As he did on the latest WeLoveGreen festival, [Fatima Yamaha](https://www.facebook.com/FatimaYamaha/) brings rays of sun with his energetic and trippy selection. Enjoy a lazy sunbath on the poolside with our complementary chill selection. Yes darling, it is for real: Summer is here.</p>

# Music & Humanity

Landing has been quite animated but you safe and your body is in good condition. You're timidly opening the door. In front of you eyes there is . A strange and austere environment still . You're now on the ground. Welcome on the Weval planet. Vous ouvrez timidement le sas de décompression. Sous vos yeux se trouve un spectacle hors du commun. Un monde étrange et austère encore infoulé. L'intensité de cet instant est palpable. Vous posez à présent votre pied à terre. Bienvenue sur la planète Weval.

# Fatima Yamaha's selection:

## Belmer - Bioroid
_Fatima Yamaha_:**"**Bioroids are genetically engineered humans that are superior in overall biology, but feature intentionally suppressed emotional capabilities. I think I run in to them on a daily basis.**"**

## Seymour Bits - Seymour Cray
_Fatima Yamaha_:**"**My name is cray, seymour cray. Mr.cray, computer main. My name is cray, now baby say, my name. Seymour cray super computer main. My puter name it's also cray it's great. Fastest ever made i'm really cray loosing my brain. Elves in the tunnel? i see them every day.**"**

## Donnie - Wubbo Ockels
_Fatima Yamaha_:**"**What is an "Ockels" and were do I get one?**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Fatima Yamaha](https://www.facebook.com/FatimaYamaha/) for his selection, we hope you enjoyed the journey!</p>
