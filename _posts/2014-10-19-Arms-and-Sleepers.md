# Here you write an attractive and engaging title

And here you speak a bit about the artist and let the inspiration flow :)

# Christian Löffler's morning inspiration
 
## Me Succeeds - Rongorongo (Arp Aubert Remix)
_Christian Löffler:_ **"**Me Succeeds and Arp Aubert are very good friends of mine and I already collaborated a lot with Mohna who is the lead singer of Me Succeeds. We are also about to release the next EP of Arp Aubert on Ki, that is currently in the making. For me this is an excellent remix of the original song by Me Succeeds and my favorite from the Rongorongo Remix LP.**"**
 
## Sean Piñeiro - Grounds
_Christian Löffler:_ **"**I think Sean is the biggest talents we have discovered on Ki so far. A real genius when it comes to atmosphere in music. I can listen to this song over and over again without getting tired about it.**"**
 
## Daisuke Tanabe - Paper Planes
_Christian Löffler:_ **"**My favorite song at the moment. Daisuke’s latest album „Floating Underwater“ was just released on our label Ki. You have to check it out, a real masterpiece.**"**
