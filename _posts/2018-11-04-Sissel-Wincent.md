<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Stockholm-based electronic producer, [Sissel Wincent](https://soundcloud.com/sissel), to MailTape. In her own music, as well as within the [Drömfakulteten collective](https://dromfakulteten.tumblr.com/), Sissel deals in a congruous style of spacious and crisply detailed studio action, exploring the spaces behind and after the notes as much as what comes in between. 
<br><br>
This morning's selection, however, trades in a joyous aqueous sound—full of mallards, dolphin squeaks and alternating compressions.</p>


# Sissel Wincent's selection

## Ploy – =O
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Gentle textures, soothing harmony, discreet bleeps—and some mallards.**"**

## Kali Malone – Locus of Repetition
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Pipe organ on a fine noise.**"**

## Mar-llena – Monorepos
_Sissel Wincent_: **"**Dolphin squeaks, waves, gloomy melodies and cleansing strings.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Sissel Wincent – Pearlescent Paint
_Sanjay_: **"**A brutally reduced minimal techno mover with a writhing acid line and spherical sound design that leaves all clichés behind and just does the job.**"**

## [Beatrice Dillon](http://www.dillonwork.com/) – Carrier and Mask
_Sanjay_: **"**Computerised, dubbed out percussion and samples meld with guitars, wah tubes, bass, pianet, and the percussive world of snare drum experimentations and rhythmic balafon. Understated and playful.**"**

## Akiko Kiyama – Gabriel
_Sanjay_: **"**[Akiko Kiyama](http://akikokiyama.com/) is a classically trained musician turned electronic music composer. I think she has a knack for magnificently slinky, trippy music. Synths twitch anxiously over a booming kick-drum and the bounce is paranoid but playful.**"**

## Afrikan Sciences – 43
_Sanjay_: **"**'Spoicke' was the first collection of music I had heard by [United Bible Studies](https://united-bible-studies.bandcamp.com/) when I picked it up in a record store in Dublin. 'Hazlehurst' is a dark ambient track in which acoustic instruments and natural sounds are electronically modulated. Notes plucked on the harp linger in the background while the other sounds appear disconnected before culminating in something that feels like a distorted daydream. If you're in London on 28th October, they'll be playing with Cath & Phil Tyler at [Cafe OTO](https://cafeoto.co.uk/events/cath-phil-tyler-united-bible-studies/).**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Mary Lattimore](http://marylattimoreharpist.tumblr.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for the illustration. Have a calm Sunday.</p>
