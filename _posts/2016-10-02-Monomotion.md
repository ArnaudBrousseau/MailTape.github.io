<p id="introduction">This morning, once again, we try something new! You'll notice that </p>

# Monomotion's selection:

## Stormzy - Shut Up
_Monomotion_: **"**Stormzy is one of the uprising UK Mc i've been following since a while now, and I really love how the panflute sounds and the colours of the synths in it. He has his own rapping style that I like!**"**

## Edyth - Agua Verde
_Monomotion_: **"**I love the samples of this track, how it's used, and how the song evolves with different theme parts.**"**

## FEYNMAN - Pray for Us
_Monomotion_: **"**I really love the chords, and the progression. The évolution is perfectly created through the build-up and the organic mixdown is one of my fav.**"**
