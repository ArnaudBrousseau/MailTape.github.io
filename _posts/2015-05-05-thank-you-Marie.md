# MailTape Crew Inspiration

## Kevin Morby - Parade
_Maxime:_ **"**Because your donation deserves a parade, but not just any parade, the most beautiful and peaceful Parade on earth. Kevin Morby's one.**"**

## Tame Impala - Let It Happen
_Ludo:_ **"**To be honest, I have never been so much of a big fan of Tame Impala in the past. But when I first listened to this track a few days ago, something definitely clicked in my head. I love the progressive and contagious energy it has. Sugar on the cake, the message behind its title is so simple and so powerful: "Let it Happen". Reminds me how no one should ever hold himself back from being open to the magic of present moments and opportunities.**"**

## Tom Misch - Brazilian Love
_Louise:_ **"**This track could fit as our definition of what "vibrant" is.
Tom Misch build his track bits by bits, with the voice first, then the beat kicks in, bass and guitar join. It's great to listen to anytime, but I think it's just perfect on a Sunday morning : imagine fresh air at your window, sunbeams on your cheeks. Enjoy!**"**

## Thundercat - For Love I come
_Olivier:_ **"**This song is for me the ideal track to wake up with on a sunday morning : the first notes are like opening your eyes on a new enchanted world where everything is beauty and peace. "Come to me, I'll rest your soul", by these words, Thundercat's angelic voice asks you to follow him through an endless journey, full of love and harmony.
Then, this jazzy drum-bass groove takes it to another level... So perfect !**"**

## Moby - Porcelain
_Siddhartha:_ **"**This is one of those songs that you instantly get hooked to. It's light and beautiful and will calm you in the deepest depths of your heart.**"**

## The Petch Phin Thong Band – Soul Lam Plearn
_Julien:_ **"**Listening to this song remember me my morning' feelings in Thaïland where I spent a year. It beautifully captures feelings I had overthere: a certain rythm, unknown tones, smells and tastes, and something slightly joyful.
Note that this song only works very well on a sunny and 30°C morning !
This song appear on a compilation 'The Sound of Siam' made by the music label Soundway Record, I recommend you to check it, they do really cool stuff. Thanks a lot for the contribution Marie !**"**

## Groves - Send High
_Dimitri:_ **"**In essence, Mailtape means discoveries and surprises. And this is also my greatest passion. This is why I do not have only one favorite song for my Sunday morning because each week i discorver an artist that comes out of nowhere with a track that can claim the glorious title of Sunday Morning Song. Send High by london's band Groves is the perfect example. Unknown yesterday, today they light my Sunday morning.**"**
