<p id="introduction">
This morning, blablabla blabla blabla 
</p>

# Saycet's morning inspiration
<br>

## Nojat Thing ft. Kazu Makino - Eclipse/Blue
_Saycet:_ **"**Kazu's voice on a Nojat Thing track, it's wonderful. Not much more to say. I've listened to this song a lot on mornings, sunday or not.**"**
 
## Shlohmo - Emerge From Smoke
_Saycet:_ **"**It's the track that I have been listening for the past two months. I love its evolution and atmosphere. This song by Shlohmo remind me of Board of Canada but more lyrical. For me, this kind of atmosphere is ideal to wake up.**"**
 
## José Gonzalez - Crosses
_Saycet:_ **"**Actually, I could have list nearly every song by José Gonzalez. There is a serenity in his music that move me deeply.**"**
