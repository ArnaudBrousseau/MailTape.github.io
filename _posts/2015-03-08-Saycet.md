# Saycet's morning inspiration
<br>
## Nojat Thing ft. Kazu Makino - Eclipse/Blue
_Saycet:_ **"**Kazu's voice on a Nojat Thing track, it's wonderful. Not much more to say. I've listened to this song a lot on mornings, sunday or not.**"**
 
## Julie Losfelt - One Against a Million

 
## José Gonzalez - Crosses
_Saycet:_ **"**Actually, I could have list nearly every song by José Gonzalez. There is a serenity in his music that move me deeply.**"**
