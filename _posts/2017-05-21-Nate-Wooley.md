<p id="introduction">This morning, we are really happy to welcome experimental trumpeter, Nate Wooley. His previous albums range from abstract renditions of Wynton Marsalis tunes to particularly harsh versions of free jazz with obscure multi-phonic trumpet chops juxtaposed against distorted extended techniques.</p>

# Nate Wooley's selection

**"**I’m going with an all Gaburo Sunday. Maybe we could term it a Gabunday? I have been utterly fascinated to the point of devotion with [Kenneth Gaburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Gaburo)’s compositions and writings for the past fifteen years and [Philip Blackburn](http://philipblackburn.com/), head of [Innova Recordings](https://www.innova.mu/) and a former student of Gaburo’s, recently made me aware of this large archive of under documented performances and interviews/lectures which has been my almost daily listening.**"**

## Rod Stewart - This Old Heart Of Mine (Ocean Edits)

_Ménage à Trois_: **"**For a mellow start to wake up slowly to and to soothe any hangover from the night before, let the soothing tines wash over your tired brain**"**

## June - Lost Area (Dj Sprinkles' Empty Dancefoor)
_Ménage à Trois_: **"**then this for memories of the weekend, but presented in a more palatable manner for a sunday morning "you made it" positive rammifications of the empty dancefloor**"**

## Dream Lovers - For Belgian Friends
_Ménage à Trois_: **"**and finally for memories of summers past at MIDI festival in Hyeres, a cover of the classic Durutti Column track. A release by a boutique label from Manchester who also released "Conditional Love" a few years ago on one of the compilation E.Ps.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Ménage à Trois - All Night Long
_Dimitri_: **"** This song will make you feel nostalgic like if it was your last night of your first holiday romance.**"**

## Babeheaven — Heaven
_Dimitri_: **"**They make you a promise and they've fulfill it. Very chill and relax, let this london based band guide you to the seven heaven. Do we want more in a sunday ? **"**

## Blue Of Noon — Guidance
_Dimitri_: **"**Guidance is a pleasant piece of dreamy surf-pop with an assumed melancholy that lets you catch a glimpse of beautiful summer prospects.**"**

## Dave Depper - Do You Want Love?
_Dimitri_: **"**Yes, I do.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to [Ménage à Trois](https://mnagetrois.bandcamp.com/) for their brillant selection. Thanks to [Célestin](http://www.slipontherock.com/) for the wonderful illustration and PS KY for her introduction.</p>
