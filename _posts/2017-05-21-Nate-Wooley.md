<p id="introduction">We are super happy to welcome experimental trumpeter, [Nate Wooley](http://natewooley.com/), in this week's issue. His previous albums range from abstract renditions of Wynton Marsalis tunes to particularly harsh versions of free jazz with obscure multi-phonic trumpet chops juxtaposed with distorted extended techniques.</p>
<p>This morning, Nate recalls the rain-soaked Pacific Northwest he once called home and provides a glimpse into his gentler Sunday morning listening.</p>

# Nate Wooley's selection

**"**I’m going with an all Gaburo Sunday. Maybe we could term it a Gabunday? I have been utterly fascinated to the point of devotion with [Kenneth Gaburo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Gaburo)’s compositions and writings for the past fifteen years and [Philip Blackburn](http://philipblackburn.com/), head of [Innova Recordings](https://www.innova.mu/) and a former student of Gaburo’s, recently made me aware of this large archive of under documented performances and interviews/lectures which has been my almost daily listening.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - TWO (1962)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**I think of Sundays as generally being rainy days, most likely owing to my upbringing in the Pacific Northwest where heavy rain is the norm. It is a very comforting feeling for me to imagine grey skies and rain and this piece for soprano voice, flute, and bass moves slowly and in a monochromatic way that causes the same feeling.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - Noyse (1975)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**My very favorite piece of Gaburo's is his Maledetto – a 50 some odd minute meditation on the word screw. It is both inappropriate for the "lord's day" plus too long for this format, but I think "Noyse" is a nice substitute. It breaks apart the phonemes of speech in a way that is both mentally engaging and somehow soothing.**"**

## Kenneth Gaburo - Mouth-Piece (1970)
_Nate Wooley_: **"**I don’t really take Sundays off which means it’s time to go to work. This recording of Mouth-Piece changed the way I look at everything on the trumpet, and so I’ll end with it as it may inspire me to wash out my coffee cup and begin practicing.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Nate Wooley 5tet - For Wee Folks
_Sanjay_: **"** This song will make you feel nostalgic like if it was your last night of your first holiday romance.**"**

## Anthony Braxton & Taylor Ho Bynum - All Roads Lead To Middletown
_Sanjay_: **"**They make you a promise and they've fulfill it. Very chill and relax, let this london based band guide you to the seven heaven. Do we want more in a sunday ? **"**

## Tom Arthurs - Chats With The Real McCoy
_Sanjay_: **"**Guidance is a pleasant piece of dreamy surf-pop with an assumed melancholy that lets you catch a glimpse of beautiful summer prospects.**"**

## Susana Santos Silva & Kaja Draksler - Hymn to the Unknown
_Sanjay_: **"**Yes, I do.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks to [Nate Wooley](http://natewooley.com/) for his exciting selections, and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for the beautiful illustration.</p>
