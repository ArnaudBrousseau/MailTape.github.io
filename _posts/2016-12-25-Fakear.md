<p id="introduction">This morning, we will explore a variety of psychedelic territories with our guests [The Holydrug Couple](https://www.facebook.com/Holydrugcouple/). Comsic, oneiric and tastily psychedelic, their music bring us in an parallel dimension where dreams and reality are one. Perfect destination for a sunday morning, isn't it ? Hope this experimental trip will make you float as high as the Andean mountains from their native Chili.</p>


# The Holydrug Couple's selection

+ ## Nicolas Godin - Widerstehe Doch Der Sünde
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This a song originally written by Bach, and re-made by Nicolas Godin by AIR. It's one of the songs that I most adore in the entire world and it's apt for every minute of every hour of the week. Simply majestic.**"**

+ ## Arco Corintio - Coronada
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This is from a new project I'm working on called Arco Corintio. I think it's perfect for a sunday morning, the time runs slow and you feel a lit of bit melancholic about the such a good time you had last nite on that party. Kinda of a gospel, it's just very simple with a couple of beautiful chords and driven by a mellow groovy bass and ace tone drum machine.**"**

+ ## Valesuchi - Golosynth
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This one is from my friend Valesuchi, called Golosynth, in spanish something like ''sweet tooth for synths''. Perfect chill for a sunday morning without losing the necesary groovness to not to comeback to bed.**"**

# Mailtape's selection

+ ## The Holydrug Couple - Concorde
_Dimitri_: **"**My favorite song from them. Bucolic and aerial, Concorde sounds like an invitation to dream that I accept without one single rejection**"**

+ ## Krakatau - Tharsis Montes
_Dimitri_: **"**Australia is one of the most exciting indie music scene to this day. Krakatau is a perfect exemple of this fertile clime. The band based in Melbourne has created its own style, highly cosmic, at the crossroads of sun-kissed funk and moonlit jazz. Tharsis Montes is the quintessence, Tharsis Montes is a masterpiece.**"**

+ ## Phil Stroud - Flow
_Dimitri_: **"**Phil Stroud is an aussie producer from Perth. He said about Flow "I hope is that it provides you with the assistance you need to feel calm and energised, that it connects you with your spirit and grounds you to the earth." I think that says it all right there.**"**

+ ## Mick Jenkins - Drowning feat. BadBadNotGood
_Dimitri_: **"**Mick Jenkins is a based Chicago rapper, few weeks ago he relased one of my best hip-hop album of the year entitled "The Healing Component". Like this Drowning featuring [BadBadNotGood](http://mailta.pe/110/BBNG/) his music is a kind of psychedelic hip-hop, result of lot of experimentations which it reminds me on some points Outkast. Really inspiring.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to [The Holydrug Couple](https://theholydrugcouple.bandcamp.com/) for their participation, and [William](http://williamgirault.com/) for the wonderful illustration. Enjoy your sunday !</p>
