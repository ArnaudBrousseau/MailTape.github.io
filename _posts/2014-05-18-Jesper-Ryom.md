. Enjoy!</p>

# A electronic tinkerer with real performer chops

I had the chance to discover Jesper Ryom through one of our previous guest Fort Rouge. Immediatly after my very first listen I got hypnotised. It seemed to me that in each of his songs there was multiple on. His debut EP is simply pure diamond. ![musiColor141.png](/img/musiColor141.png)
You can pre-order it on [bandcamp](http://atomnation.bandcamp.com/album/moon-observations "Pre-order now!").

# His morning selection

## Your Friend - Tame One
Jesper Ryom: **"**Your Friend released her debut EP on one of my favorite labels, Domino, in the beginning of April. This single from the EP is beautifully balanced song-writing. Love her voice, the lyrics and lofi-ishness of the recording. Especially the drums.**"**

## The War on Drugs - Red Eyes
Jesper Ryom: **"**I guess everybody’s heard this already, but I don’t care - you should listen to it again. It’s amazing.**"**

## Fort Romeau - Her Dream
Jesper Ryom: **"**Fort Romeau is such a great producer - only drops quality tunes. This one from his latest EP is no exception. Love the semi-crooked beat and that looming bass line is super cool as well.**"**
