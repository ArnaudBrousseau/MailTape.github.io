<p id="introduction">This sunday, enjoy [TOYS](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music "TOYS' Soundcloud stream")' eclectic selection and enjoy their very inspirational episode where pop, electronic, indie music and vintage sounds will help you take benefits of this day.</p>

Led by Paul Prier and Benoît Doremus, TOYS is mainly a family story
which starts in a Parisian studio, a place that will quickly become the band's new home. A story that thrives on common foundations and
passion for electronic music, from Space to Kevin Saunderson, through
Pink Floyd and Jay Dee.

At the beginning, there was [Noise](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music/noise "Noise by TOYS on Soundcloud"), their first single released two years ago, featured on "Kitsuné Parisien 3" compilation. Then, few months later comed [Hey Boy](https://soundcloud.com/toys-music/hey-boy-1 "Hey Boy by TOYS on Soundcloud"), a little gem of electronic production with soulful accents.

After severals remix (Two Door Cinema Club, Breton, Lescop, François & the Atlas Mountain), they come back with their brand new EP where 'Golden Line', the first single, is accompanied by a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F7-mqFbSYA "Golden Line music video on YouTube") directed by Vladimir de Fontenay. The video was presented in South by Southwest Film Festival (SXSW), Texas.


# TOYS' morning inspiration

## Donnie & Joe Emerson - Baby
_TOYS:_ **"**A track that we listen often. This song has a rather improbable story : it was recorded in the late 70's by two brothers, Joe and Donnie, whose father, producer of the band, had built a studio in the family farm to produce their sons. At the time, their album did not work at all and the band was completely forgotten until a record collector rediscovered the vinyl in 2008, in a flea market !
There is something touching in this piece, the production is a little awkward but its heartfelt songwriting and its interpretation made it a small soul masterpiece...**"**

## Unknown Mortal Orchestra - Multi-Love
_TOYS:_ **"**We like everything in this track : drum & voice treatment, psychedelic-pop energy featured with a bit of house music, the overall production... Their new album is about to be released in a couple of days, we can't wait to listen to it !**"**

## Spooky Black - Without You
_TOYS:_ **"**A small american prodigy of 16 years, he's the result of a completely autonomous generation member of a group of ultra promising rapper (the stand4rd) whose artistic maturity continues to impress. We love this simple and beautiful piece , almost hard to believe that it was done by someone so young...**"**
