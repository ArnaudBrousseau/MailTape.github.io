<p id="introduction">
This morning, here's a Mailtape inspired by [Barney Artist](http://www.barneyartist.com "Barney Artist's website"). Apud has gentes, quarum exordiens initium ab Assyriis ad Nili cataractas porrigitur et confinia Blemmyarum, omnes pari sorte sunt bellatores seminudi coloratis sagulis pube tenus amicti. </p>
 
# Ethearal vibes
 
Apud has gentes, quarum exordiens initium ab Assyriis ad Nili cataractas porrigitur et confinia Blemmyarum, omnes pari sorte sunt bellatores seminudi coloratis sagulis pube tenus amicti, equorum adiumento pernicium graciliumque camelorum per diversa se raptantes, in tranquillis vel turbidis rebus: nec eorum quisquam aliquando stivam adprehendit vel arborem colit aut arva subigendo quaeritat victum, sed errant semper per spatia longe lateque distenta sine lare sine sedibus fixis aut legibus: nec idem perferunt diutius caelum aut tractus unius soli illis umquam placet.
 
# Barney Artist's morning inspiration
 
## Jordan Rakei - Add The Bassline (Nehzuil Remix)
_Barney Artist:_ **"**I'm a huge Jordan Rakei fan : really love his voice and the musicality of his songs. When I heard this Nehzuil remix of Add The Bassline lets just say it was played every Sunday from then on. Great vibes!**"**
 
## Alfa & Emmavie - Easily, I Forget
_Barney Artist:_ **"**So, I had to throw some of my musical family in the mix of this Sunday playlist. Alfa Mist and Emmavie made an incredible EP called _Epoch_ earlier this year and it was so difficult to choose just one song from it but _Easily I forget_ stands out as its melodies, instrumentation and lyrics throw you into a trance.**"**
 
## IDEH - Do Something
_Barney Artist:_ **"**This track is by a really cool new artist from London _Ideh_. This song reminds me a lot of Brandy on her _Afrodisiac_ album really love the production by V beats and the tones from Ideh. Have a listen and vibe out with me this Sunday.**"**
