## Pete Drake and his talking steel guitar - Forever
_Trevor:_ **"**Nothing sets a magical mood like the album "Pete Drake and His Singing Steel Guitar". For decades Pete was a famous session musician with his masterful pedal steel guitar playing, and even produced records, but on this album he breathed new and eerie life into popular hits of the 1960's by playing his pedal steel guitar through a talk box. It sounds like a novelty act, but the record stands out in my collection as one of the most strange and original from that time in pop music. **"**

## Novicat de Soeurs Missionaires - Yesu Ka Mkwebaze
_Asagaya:_ **"**I first heard this track on a Mississippi Records compilation. I love how the gentle percussion, which has a sort of slow and steady heartbeat rhythm driving the composition, carries the beautiful vocal melodies floating over it. This song has a hymn-ish quality to it, and spiritual folk music like this has a special place on my record player come Sundays. **"**
