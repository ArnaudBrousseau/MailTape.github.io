<p id="introduction">This morning, enjoy the musical universe of a charming modern crooner. His first album "Passion Fruit", like a bottle in the sea, has been launch last year by the Great Trevor Dickson. Since this date, i respond to his musical happiness. I'm completely submerged by all his tiny ballads. Each one make my travel around the world. All this exotics percussion mixed with his crooner voice, sound to me as a fresh summer cocktail. I can't pass besides this album, I came back to it every time. Prepare to have to respond to his sweet call too. </p>
 
# This charming character
 
At first, I fall down to his wonderful clip for "Power". Where he has created a charming character, a naive east cost dandy, who fall in love to a wonderful blond who walk on brooklyn' s beach. That kind of guy who can speak hours about traditional pacific chorals or futuristic musical instruments of the 50s. His poetry is as sweet as his references. I hope Trevor'll launched an other bottle/album across the atlantic, to respond to him again. 
 
# His sweet sunday morning's selection
 
## Pete Drake and his talking steel guitar - Forever
_Trevor:_ **"**Nothing sets a magical mood like the album "Pete Drake and His Singing Steel Guitar". For decades Pete was a famous session musician with his masterful pedal steel guitar playing, and even produced records, but on this album he breathed new and eerie life into popular hits of the 1960's by playing his pedal steel guitar through a talk box. It sounds like a novelty act, but the record stands out in my collection as one of the most strange and original from that time in pop music. **"**
 
## Billie Holiday - Gloomy sunday
_Trevor:_ **"**Not much needs to be said here. It's Billie Holiday. Few other recorded voices have managed to hypnotize me the way hers has. I just close my eyes and get completely lost in it.
**"**
 
## Novicat de Soeurs Missionaires - Yesu Ka Mkwebaze
_Asagaya:_ **"**I first heard this track on a Mississippi Records compilation. I love how the gentle percussion, which has a sort of slow and steady heartbeat rhythm driving the composition, carries the beautiful vocal melodies floating over it. This song has a hymn-ish quality to it, and spiritual folk music like this has a special place on my record player come Sundays. **"**
