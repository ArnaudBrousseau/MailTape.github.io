<p id="introduction">This morning, we are extremely pleased to welcome [Buvette](https://buvette.bandcamp.com/) and let him start our Sunday. His latest album [Elasticity](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/elasticity), recorded in Paris at Point Ephemere Studios and released on 2016, played on repeat as I was driving the roads of the Dead Sea last summer. 
  
  Since then, I've been looking forward to releasing an episode with him. This gentle mindbomb starts with a 20minute-ish track to help you relax and let yourself get into a trip of exploration, love, creativity, passion and realization. Let's go...</p>


# Buvette's selection

## [Terekke](https://terekke.bandcamp.com/) - NuWav2
_Buvette_: **"**This thing is magic. If you listen to it on Sunday morning you can relive the best moment of the day before, in slow motion. Then you really wake up and it gets more and more intense. You may smile when you read to me, but in my opinion this music is very strong because through the place it leaves to auto-suggestion, you can really transpose what you want into it. Imagine a big kick over it now. Then a hi-hat, a bass line. Hop, it stops and here comes the lyrical singer who joins us. Anything is possible You are free to feel what you want. It's deadly.**"**

## [Losange](https://johnkoolrecords.bandcamp.com/album/quartz) - Spleen Sidéral
_Buvette_: **"**A song that I like very much and that I put in several mixes. Now is the time to get up and open the curtains on a morning full of promises.**"**

## [Vashti Bunyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashti_Bunyan) - Love Song
_Buvette_: **"**The day I have children I will wake them up and fall asleep with Vashti's music.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Buvette - All the Sounds in One
_ImaCrea_: **"**It's been difficult to choose a track given that his album, [Elasticity](https://paneuropeanrecording.bandcamp.com/album/elasticity), is so full of great tracks. 'All the Sounds in One' is a kind of trip summarizing the overall feeling of it, in fact that is its last track. And this voice...**"**

## AMA//MIZU - Waiting Room (Face To Face)
_ImaCrea_: **"**dsd**"**

## Sunken - Swoon
_ImaCrea_: **"**[sdd**"**

## Kate Tempest - Pictures on a Screen
_ImaCrea_: **"**dsd**"**
