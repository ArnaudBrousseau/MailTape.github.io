<p id="introduction"> Hello there, this morning we gonna talk about the world. I mean, talk about Michelle Blades, a mexicano-Panamanian woman who lived since 2012 in USA, then moved to Paris. It's quiet the same than talking about globalisation. Even if her music was not inspired by her life, we could be speak about this itinerary and compare it to her music. But she simplified our job, her life is totally reflected by her music. Let talk about the world of Michelle Blades. </p>

She is great exemple of a work where experimentation is a finality. She could do punk, folk or electronial pop, we can detect a michelle Blades’s style. Her muscial experiment is proportional to her life's mileage. Every gender of music created can be joined to a country, or a city. As "New Friends", a song wrote during the attacks in November in Paris, she talks about her new friends locked up in a bar in Paris, thinking back to his old friends in Pheonix, Arizona. She choosen to use an electronical cumbia behind her lyrics. In a way, this song is a life review. 


# Haunting and elusive music

"Eternal Fugitive" is the last song of her last EP "Polylust". Does she run out something, or does she keep searching ? It's that kind of questions she ask herself

xxxx
 
# Michelle Blades's selection:

## Stephen Steinbrink - The Punks

Michelle Blades: "Stephen and I used to live in the same town and he's been one of my favorite artists all around ever since I came across his music. This song in particular is special as it talks about aspects of living in Tempe/Phoenix and being part of the music scene there. True folk."

## Victor Jara - Te recuerdo Amanda

Michelle Blades: "Probably my favorite song of his. Political, folkloric, romantic & tragic all at the same time. It's like a cocktail I wish I could drink."

## Eddy Crampes - Automne

Michelle Blades: "I met Eddy while he was working on the finishing touches for Laure Briard's upcoming album. Watching him work and listening to his arrangements made me wonder what  his own work was like. I'm so glad I discovered his weird brilliant pop.  "
