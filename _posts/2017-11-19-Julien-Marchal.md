<p id="introduction">Our artist of the week, Julien Marchal, has something unique to share. A contemporary pianist and composer from Bordeaux, France. His contemplative and minimalist pieces seem to be an invocation of the classical art. Melancholic and yet uplifting, here’s an artist whose harmony will lend you the peace of mind you so deserve as you touch upon on the world of modern classical. 
</p>

# Here and now

Having drawn inspiration from the likes of Eric Satie and Philip Glass, his piano pieces go on to orchestrate the symphony of life. With each passing note, the listener is brought close to the realization that life is here and now. There’s a calmness that solemnly settles in you; causing you to slowly and mindfully accepting life as it is. That said, one is often left to wonder, that if there were to be a musical expression of life, it couldn’t have been more precise than this. 



# Julien Marchal's selection

## Novo Amor & Ed Tullett - Faux
_Julien Marchal_: **"**First listen of this track, the only thing I was thinking was : « who’s that voice? I want to work with him! ». I really like the work of Novo Amor (Ali Lacey) and Ed Tullett. I think they’ve created a beautiful duo of composer and I hope they will continue to create some other beautiful songs like this one.**"**

##  Christian Loeffler - Mare (Robot Koch Remix) 
_Julien Marchal_: **"**Because I love the warmth and the deep of his basses, the minimal electronic composition with sound design addition on his tracks. And even more since we’re collaborate. **"**

## Jonwayne - These Words Are Everything
_Julien Marchal_: **"**I love Jonwayne’s music to give more energy without being excited. I love so much different kind of music that I would like to make 100 different mailtapes. ;) **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Yazz Ahmed — La Saboteuse
_Sanjay_: **"**It's hard for me to pick just one track from Yazz's latest album, 'La Saboteuse'. This piece begins with Shabaka Hutchings's solo bass clarinet which evokes a beautiful sadness, like a craggy autumnal landscape. Yazz’s trumpet melody is magisterial, composed of Arabic scales, which are counterpointed with a quiet and foreboding percussion.**"**

## Fran & Flora – The Hollow Tree
_Sanjay_: **"**Stark and eerie...like a hollow tree, this track consists of cello and violin beautifully played by [Fran and Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/), respectively. They fuse traditional motifs of Eastern European music with their own experimental compositions and improvisation. I'm looking forward to their upcoming debut album. Such a cool duo!**"**

## Zoe Rahman — Shiraz
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from pianist [Zoe Rahman](http://www.zoerahman.com/). I've seen her perform a couple of times in London and Leicester and I love the rhythmic ruminations with repeating low themes emerging in the gaps between treble trills in this track. If you're in London, Zoe will be performing [solo at lunchtime on 13th November](https://www.pizzaexpresslive.com/whats-on/zoe-rahman) as part of this year's jazz festival.**"**

## Vijay Iyer Trio — Break Stuff
_Sanjay_: **"**In this title track from the [Vijay Iyer Trio](http://vijay-iyer.com/), the unbridled energy of Vijay Iyer’s piano is grounded by Marcus Gilmore’s drums and Stephan Crump’s bass. They create a mesmeric tension, as the track builds towards and dissolves into a contrastingly meditative break in which earlier motifs are deconstructed. Here, also, the drums quietly emerge for the first time before ceding the melody to the piano, which gradually regains its earlier intensity. If you haven't done so already, I'd recommend hearing Vijay—alongside his many ensembles—live!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Yazz Ahmed](http://yazzahmed.com/) for being our guest, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
