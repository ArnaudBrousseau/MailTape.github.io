With sounds as smooth and glossy as the milk in your artisanal coffee, tempered by [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook")'s own sugary croon, it'll be hard to not slurp this sultry concoction straight down, feeling the caffeinated kaleidoscope shimmer behind your eyes. Relinquish your aching 70s soul to this silky sonic lagoon deluxe.</p>


# **TRAAMS' selection**

+ ## Silk Rhodes - Stuck in my Head
_TRAAMS_: **"**Mike & Sasha are good friends, and wonderful tunesmiths, particularly the work they do in Silk Rhodes is the perfect mixture of the sultry, smooth & the eclectic. Minimal soul at its finest and an adequate sensual Sunday accompaniment.**"**

+ ## Jerry Paper - Gracie II
_TRAAMS_: **"**Lucas has a real ear for the understated, his melodies are so strong yet so oblique. This tune however is probably his sweetest most direct ballad thus far. [Badbadnotgood](https://www.mailta.pe/110/bbng/ "MailTape 110") providing rhythm section too can never be bad when you're in the need for some subtle grooves.**"**

+ ## Bwengo Nuabey - Secondarny
_TRAAMS_: **"**This guy is second to none when it comes to quality over quantity. This one'll get you feeling all worldly + eastern intrigued. Essential Sunday listening.**"**
