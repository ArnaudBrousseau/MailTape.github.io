<p id="introduction">This morning, we challenge you to resist the lure of [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook"), the new and mysterious incarnation of Egyptian Hip-Hop's former frontman. With sounds as smooth and glossy as the milk in your artisanal coffee, tempered by [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook")'s own sugary croon, it'll be hard to not slurp this sultry concoction straight down, feeling the caffeinated kaleidoscope shimmer behind your eyes. Relinquish your aching 70s soul to this silky sonic lagoon deluxe.</p>


# **TRAAMS' selection**

+ ## Chelsea Wolfe - After The Fall
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning with something equal parts soothing and sinister? 'After The Fall' is a powerful song, the shattering wall of sound behind the soaring vocals of the chorus bit knocks me off my feet every time. A great artist, Chelsea Wolfe stands apart from her contemporaries, and this song is one of her best. This song will wake you up for sure.**"**

+ ## Patty Griffin - Ohio
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning with a song that carries you out of your Sunday morning slumber? 'Ohio' is a carefully constructed song with its strength in melody and subtlety. A gleaming gem from her somewhat overlooked latter-career masterpiece 'American Kid'.**"**

+ ## The Tammys - Egyptian Shumba
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning by just dancing loads? Simply one of the greatest Pop songs ever recorded, pure joy in melody and rhythm. The Egyptian Shumba will ensure your Sunday is a stonker.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## TRAAMS - Low
_Inès_: **"**This band has so much energy - in studio versions or live - Give a listen to 'A House on Fire': 8 minutes of pure energetic fuzzy guitar madness, so amazing. **"**
