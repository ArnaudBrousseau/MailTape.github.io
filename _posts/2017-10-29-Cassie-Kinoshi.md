<p id="introduction">Described by Songlines magazine as ‘bold and poetic… beautiful and fearless', we are delighted to share vocalist [Amira Kheir's](http://amirakheir.com/) Sunday morning listening for MailTape.</p>
<p>As a young singer, musician and composer, Amira draws from her own multicultural background to create music that explores themes of home, belonging, love, and unity. Within this soudscape, East African rhythms blend with North African ambience, through hints of Afro-Latin grooves and Neo-Soul, expressing themselves through a soulful explosion of jazz improvisation. Amira’s music possesses within it ancient musical traditions, yet is delivered with a contemporary vibrancy reflective of London’s multicultural music scene.</p>


# Cassie Kinoshi's selection



## Kiran Kai ft. Jordan Rakei & Bdrsk – FF
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**As a freelancer, I often forget to take care of my mental well-being by dedicating time to myself. I’ve been trying to prioritise self-care in my schedule and slowly started to introduce what I call “Self-care Sundays” where I relax and take it easy for the whole day. This is the perfect tune to accompany easing into a reflective Sunday morning with a cup of tea.**"**

## Andrew Poppy – Last Light
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**[Andrew Poppy](http://www.andrewpoppy.co.uk/Welcome.html) has always been a composer I’ve admired since having him as a teacher at university. I feel that he’s is one of the reasons I survived at conservatoire! This piece has been on repeat for a while—I really enjoy listening to compositions that are full of texture, colour and so abstractly beautiful that you lose yourself within and becoming enveloped in the sound.**"**

## Oscar Jerome – You Take Me
_Cassie Kinoshi_: **"**One of my favourite guitarists on the London scene to work with; I was super excited when I heard that [Oscar Jerome](https://twitter.com/oscjerome) would finally be releasing his music last year. The writing, production and arrangements on this EP are so thorough—you can tell Oscar put his heart and soul into making this and his music never fails to transport me every time I listen.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Cassie Kinoshi ft. Heidi Heidelberg — The Dream Keeper
_Sanjay_: **"**There's so much to love about Amira's music. Her arrangements and imaginative melodies are atmospheric, evoking open spaces. Although quite an impersonal space, her performance yesterday afternoon in Trafalgar Square, London, for Black History Month 2017 was a brief journey through her burgeoning discography.**"**

## Mazz Swift – Invisible (Dedicated to Trayvon Martin and his Family)
_Sanjay_: **"**I saw Mazz perform last Sunday with [Hear in Now](http://www.hearinnow.com/) at The Vortex in London and imediately associated **"**

## Collocutor — Arrival
_Sanjay_: **"**This track is taken from the second album by [Collocutor](https://collocutor.uk/), a London-based ensemble led by saxophonist [Tamar Osborn](https://tamarosborn.com/).**"**

## Moses Boyd Exodus — Nocturne
_Sanjay_: **"**This was the first song I heard from [Lhasa de Sela](http://lhasadesela.com/) and her voice seems so intense throughout this album. To me, it's a hopeful song on an otherwise sombre and reflective album, produced and released during her 21-month battle with breast cancer, which she lost on January 1st 2010.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks so much for listening and love to [Amira Kheir](http://amirakheir.com/) for being our guest this morning, and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for this episode's beautiful illustration!</p>
