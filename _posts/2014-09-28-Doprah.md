Your story here Sidd :)
 
# Doprah's morning inspiration
 
## Sea Oleena - If I'm
_Doprah:_ **"**Sea Oleena is an artist I've very recently discovered. I have no idea where she's based.. I think her sound has this real quietness of mind and a very melancholic simplicity to it. Especially towards the end, Sea Oleena creates such a comforting sound in this track that feels just like laying mindlessly in bed in the morning. **"**
 
## Club Kuru - All The Days
_Doprah:_ **"**I first saw club kuru on some blog with 2 other tracks like a year ago and everyday since then i've been depressed that thats it. There are only two songs you can find. I love this song and the production is so smooth. I wish i knew how to do the crazy drum programming shit at the end of it. **"**
 
## Alexandre Angrignon - Turning Red
_Doprah:_ **"**I was really into (Sidewalk) Meese which was alex's previous project but i think this song is just really great song writing. not only musically but lyrically as well.**"**
