# The _Cool & Smooth_ Jazzment
Three albums released on their [bandcamp page](http://url "check their bandcamp folks !") that can follow you everywhere. With calm, clarity, the dutch duo wrap you in a perfect and delightful mood. Sit snugly with a good cup of coffee and listen to this selection they're sharing with us.

# Enjoy their morning selection

## Mo Kolours - Mike Black
**"**Probably hard to believe, but besides us there are some other dope producers representing the Netherlands. Personally we find Henning one of the illest, bringing back that West-Coast G-funk sound. He definitely has the smoothest beats of the country.**"**

## Nicolas Jaar & Theatre Roosevelt - The Ego
**"**Probably hard to believe, but besides us there are some other dope producers representing the Netherlands. Personally we find Henning one of the illest, bringing back that West-Coast G-funk sound. He definitely has the smoothest beats of the country.**"**

## Beyond The Sun f. J - Live
