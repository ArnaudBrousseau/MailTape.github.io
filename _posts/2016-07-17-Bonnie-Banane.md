# Title 



# Bonnie Banane's selection:

## Willow Smith - twentyfourtyeight 2.0
_Talitres_: **"**I like this song from Willow while drinking cold water when I wake up.
Tons of water.**"**

## George Duke - Tzina
_Talitres_: **"**Then I put on George Duke, right before I make my bed and open the windows
letting fresh air come through. I stretch legs too.**"**

## Lala &Ce 67 - Jessica Jones
_Talitres_: **"**Lala &ce, right before I get out to get some fruits and hot bread with my lover
come back and eat slowly. That's a good sunday morning for me.**"**
