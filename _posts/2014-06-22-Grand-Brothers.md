<p id="introduction">
This morning, the Bordeaux-based French pop band [Pendentif](http://www.pendentifmusic.com/ "Pendentif Website") has prepared you a musical cocktail to be enjoyed without reserve...</p>

# Lifeblood pop

blabla

#Their morning selection

## Nils Frahm - Re
_Grand Brothers:_ **"**Nils' music has always been a big inspiration to us - his way of combining sadness with beauty is simply brilliant. Imagine this song on a rainy sunday, you're slightly hung over, you don't want to see anyone... you'll feel happier - or sadder - probably both...**"**

## Jono McCleery - Ballade
_Grand Brothers:_ **"**After you've woken up hardly, this song has the perfect flow to get through the day. And that voice...**"**

## Grey Reverend - Nightingale
_Grand Brothers:_ **"**This one should be on everyone's alarm clock. After the first ten seconds of that catchy intro you should instantly get up, make yourself a cup of coffee and enjoy your day.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to [Grandbrothers](https://www.facebook.com/grandbrothers "Grandbrothers Facebook") for their selection and to Mirka Pflüger for the photo. Thanks for listening, enjoy your sunday !
