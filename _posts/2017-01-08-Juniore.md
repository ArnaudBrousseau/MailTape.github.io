<p id="introduction">Introduction blabla</p>

# Headline 1

If anything is sure, it's that our vitals need some love before facing the coming year, and Australian funk maestro [Inkswel](https://inkswel.bandcamp.com/) has us covered, with all the musical nutrients necessary to kick start 2017 and get our bodies moving in a way that would make even James Brown proud. So forget who and where and why you are, while we channel this cosmic mix down the copper wires and into your soul. Let the quest for musical utopias continue.

# Juniore's selection

+ ## Santo et Johnny - Sleepwalk
_Juniore_: **"**For mornings lazy, the mornings courbaturés, the mornings fuzzy, Sunday after a stirred Saturday, a good dose of cottony guitars, velvety melodies, it has the effect of a syrup that puts ideas (and organs) in law. As the mysterious Mary Poppins says: "A piece of sugar that helps medicine flow." Guaranteed efficiency.**"**

+ ## Air - Ce matin-là
_Juniore_: **"**For morning mornings and unjust mornings, when everyone is asleep and you have to get up, let yourself be rocked a bit by the moon and timeless harmonies of "That morning". Everything seems lighter, less serious and it gets better.**"**

+ ## Erik Satie - Gymnopédie N°1
_Juniore_: **"**For the morose moros, nostalgic, or simply the serene mornings (must also happen) A Gnossienne or a Gymnopédie Eric Sati for a moment of contemplation, a dream awake.**"**
