# Headline 1

Juniore is a all-female band led by the parisian Anna Jean. 

# Juniore's selection

+ ## Santo et Johnny - Sleepwalk
_Juniore_: **"**For the lazy mornings, the tougher or the fuzzy ones. For the sunday morning that follow a restless Saturday, a great deal guitars made of cotton, creamy melodies, this track is like a syrup that gets your head (and organs) straight. As the mysterious Mary Poppins says: "A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down". Efficiency guarantees.**"**

+ ## Air - Ce matin-là
_Juniore_: **"**For the workin' and unjust mornings, when everyone is asleep and you have to get up, let yourself be rocked a bit by the lunar and timeless harmonies of "Ce matin-là". Everything seems lighter, less serious and it gets better.**"**

+ ## Erik Satie - Gymnopédie N°1
_Juniore_: **"**For the morose and nostalgic mornnings. Or simply the mornings full of serenity (yes, it must also happen, Satie's Gnossienne or Gymnopédie is the best solution for a moment full of contemplation, a waking dream.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Juniore - Panique
_Olivier_: **"**With this track, Juniore transform their surf pop into an addictive and stressfull pop. As we enter this new year, the world around is becoming more and more worrisome and Anna Jean use this track to express her feelings about it. She makes a kind of mockery of it by telling an inconsequent story of a panic in love. With catchy lyrics, vigorous and stressfull lines of guitars and organs supported by a restless drum, the whole thing put torgether into a hectic mix, Panique is like a steamroller that will boost your day!**"**
