<p id="introduction">As winter is definitely anchored, there is nothing like staying in bed, enjoying a warm coffee with a delicious breakfast, listening some very comforting tracks, like a candy for the ears... And that's what we carefully crafted for you today with [Juniore|https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com], a french indie-pop band.

Instrumental tracks, smooth vibrations like a warm sonic blankets : this morning selection begins with some soothing classical records picked by Juniore, just to help you arise from Morphee's kingdom. Then, we help you realize that Hey, there are plenty of inspiring things to do today with more percussive tracks. The whole thing with a bit of french accent and inspirations from the recklessness sounds from the 60's...
</p>

# Ghosts, Towns, Cars and Girls tales...

[Juniore|https://heyjuniore.bandcamp.com] is a all-female band led by the parisian Anna Jean. With their surf-pop deeply anchored in the sixties, Juniore's music is made of reverbed guitars coupled to vocal harmonies full of spleen and rythms, inspired by a world of ghosts, towns, cars and girls tales...

# Juniore's selection

+ ## Santo et Johnny - Sleepwalk
_Juniore_: **"**For the lazy mornings, the tougher or the fuzzy ones. For the sunday morning that follow a restless Saturday, a great deal guitars made of cotton, creamy melodies, this track is like a syrup that gets your head (and organs) straight. As the mysterious Mary Poppins says: "A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down". Efficiency guarantees.**"**

+ ## Air - Ce matin-là
_Juniore_: **"**For the workin' and unjust mornings, when everyone is asleep and you have to get up, let yourself be rocked a bit by the lunar and timeless harmonies of "Ce matin-là". Everything seems lighter, less serious and it gets better.**"**

+ ## Erik Satie - Gymnopédie N°1
_Juniore_: **"**For the morose and nostalgic mornnings. Or simply the mornings full of serenity (yes, it must also happen, Satie's Gnossienne or Gymnopédie is the best solution for a moment full of contemplation, a waking dream.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Juniore - Panique
_Olivier_: **"**With this track, Juniore transform their surf-pop into an addictive and stressfull pop. As we enter this new year, the world around is becoming more and more worrisome and Anna Jean use this song to express her feelings about it. She makes a kind of mockery of it by telling an inconsequent story of a panic in love. With catchy lyrics, vigorous and stressfull lines of guitars and organs supported by a restless drum, the whole thing put torgether into a hectic mix, Panique is like a steamroller that will boost your day!**"**

+ ## GYM - Your Woman (White Town cover)
_Olivier_: **"**I've picked this track mostly because of this haunted bell melody that is the perfect answer to Juniore's Panique atmosphere. Then, the bouncing bass line makes us noding our head unconsciously and GYM singer's indolent voice lead us to a realy good mood!**"**

+ ## Jo Wedin & Jean Felzine - Idiot
_Olivier_: **"**Nothing better than this song to pay tribute to the sounds of the sixties and to the iconic love duo that were recorded at that time. As Juniore kept the "darker" sides of those years, full of cowboy boots and two-time motors, this song reflects the touching innocence of this era. Both singers act beautifuly their role in this drama. It's perfect to start the day with fresh and enthusiastic ideas.**"**

+ ## Lemon Swell - Track
_Olivier_: **"**Blabla**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks, thanks to Juniore for their selection... </p>
