<p id="introduction">This morning, our guest Run Child Run has blessed us with a distinctive selection of timeless tracks.</p>


## Vanishing point. 

A point at which something disappears or ceases to exist. Have you ever felt it? Lived it? Experienced it? That point on the horizon where things are simply fading away, transforming into something mysterious and unknown. We all have seen it or maybe even just felt it, in an experience, the end of something, a metamorphosis. 

Run Child Run’s music will accompany you on this journey. His music rises from the soil, spreading out and beyond, lashing out sparks of star dust into the infinite matter. Run Child Run’s music is like a mystical silk veil engulfing you in a comforting yet blissful atmosphere. His tastes in music are just as delicate and touching, no drama, things are pure, joyful and filled with everlasting moments of emptiness perceived. 


# Run Child Run's selection

## Solange - Rise
_Run Child Run_: **"**Just a beautiful way to open an album, and a beautiful way to start a day.**"**

## Hugh - I Can't Figure You Out
_Run Child Run_: **"**I love the balance this song strikes, light on its feet yet full of yearning. And how much they translate with so few elements, its lovely.**"**

## JOYCE - Aldeia de Ogum 
_Run Child Run_: **"**One of my 1yr-old son's favorite songs, and has been since he was in the womb. Warms my heart everytime.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Run Child Run - Can't Catch Me
_ImaCrea_: **"**A soothing bass line, a sparkling guitar, and an overall luxurious, blissful feeling: JOEY FOURR’s albums have been some of the albums I listened to the most in the past six months, one of my latest musical crushes. ‘JEWELS’ is one of my favourite songs, always so so good each time I listen to it.**"**

## Common Body - Luck Of The Draw
_ImaCrea_: **"**Basically a super catchy pop tune with amazing vocals. Effortlessly cool.**"**

## De Lux - 875 Dollars
_ImaCrea_: **"**Moving on now to some disco-punk niceness to keep dancing your Sunday away!**"**

## Aegean Sun - Feel Real
_ImaCrea_: **"**Let's end this streak full of good vibes with this sunny psychedelic song, making us forget that it's still winter outside.**"**
