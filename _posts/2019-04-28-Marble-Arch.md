# Marble Arch's selection

## Deerhunter - Helicopter
_Marble Arch_: **"**Very atmospheric track, it's pure Bradford Cox, it could be taken from Atlas sound's LP "let the blind lead those who can see but can not feel" finally.
It is a slow song, quiet, bright ... Simply verses with chorus that always give me chills.It's powerful but delicate with a crescendo end and especially this snare details at 3:42, genius ...**"**

## Muddy Monk - Si l'on ride
_Marble Arch_: **"**I love this song, and all the songs of Muddy Monk to be honest.
I think we must have the same influences. Every time I see a new MM's track, I'm sure that I will love it. Atmospheric synth (as usual I love that ;-)) heady notes, bass line ... Perfect to get up at dawn, when everything is still sleeping.**"**

## Simply Red - Holding back the years
_Marble Arch_: **"**This is my guilty pleasure, I love this song so much. My father used to listen to it a lot, it brings me back. It seems to me that this is the theme of this song.It's super sweet, melancholy, nostalgic but it puts me in a good mood!**"**


# MailTape's selection

_Ana誰s G_: **"****"**

## BadBadNotGood - 
_Ana誰s G_: **"****"**

## Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead
