<p id="introduction">This morning electronic producer and instrument builder, [Crewdson](http://crewdson.net/), provides us with three tracks that slowly lift him from his Sunday morning slumber.</p>
<p>He creates sound from machinery, found items, manipulated vocals, saxophone, traditional concertina and his self-designed ‘concertronica’, which he samples and manipulates through his idiosyncratic electronic set up, controlling sounds with game controllers and MIDI motorcycle handlebars.</p>
<p>Crewdson's second album on Slowfoot Records, [Toys](http://slowfootrecords.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/crewdson-out-now-toys-lp.html), was built using these instruments and ends a five-year gap between his full-length releases. And if you're in Brighton, he'll be playing with Bambooman at the [Green Door Store](http://thegreendoorstore.co.uk/events/bambooman-27-09-17/) on 27th September.</p> 


# Crewdson's selection


## Steve Reich - Music For 18 Musicians (Section 1)
_Crewdson_: **"**Music for 18 musicians is in my mind an almost perfect piece of music. It both shifts, grows and evolves over the full 60 mins whilst also feeling like a single moment in time put under the microscope an magnified over and over getting ever closer and closer towards a point with no end. I think I could listen to it forever.**"**

## Lau - Far From Portland
_Crewdson_: **"**Lau are my absolute favourite band in the world right now. They are three of the most incredibly gifted musicians on a technical level but when they get together something pretty magic happens, their music sounds both totally new and ancient at the same time. I love the bits of electronics blended in with the traditional folk. If you ever get a chance to see them live it is an incredible experience, you would not be disappointed.**"**

## Bambooman - Sun (Eckoclick Remix)
_Crewdson_: **"**This is a bit cheeky of me to choose as I did the production on it but its definitely one of those Sunday morning electronic tunes. It is also a collaboration with 2 of my favourite musicians that I work closely with being Bambooman and Femme, the mixture of the formers production style coupled with the latter's vocals is a real treat.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Crewdson - Dwarf Star
_Sanjay_: **"**You won't find this one on either of Crewdson's albums, but if you're familiar with his work you'll definitely recognise the choppy drums, tight basslines, mellow synths, manipulated vocals, incidental noises and layers of plinky, metallic, high-frequency content – like he’s sampled absolutely everything. Far from feeling unsettled, Crewdson straddles the borders of rhythm, melody and noise nicely.**"**

## Cassie Kinoshi — 8-Bit: I. "Tetris"
_Sanjay_: **"**After studying with free-jazz pianist Cecil Taylor, the Pyramids left for a journey through Africa in 1972 where they developed their own musical vision. On Rhapsody in Berlin this vision is still vibrating; a melodic horn nestles with a Pygmy flute, some driving riffs and a heavy funk rhythm. If you look out for Part 2, the rhapsody explodes and the saxophone takes off before merging into an ecstasy of percussion. And if you're in London on Wednesday, [just go and see them!](http://theoldqueenshead.com/whats-on/earmusic-2-2017-08-02/)**"**

## Suphala — Eight And A Half Birds
_Sanjay_: **"**If you're of the means to buy physical products, the beautiful illustrations, calligraphy and Yazz's own entertaining sleeve notes make this a worthy purchase before even getting to the music. And it's just as good. The alternating seven-eight percussive metre in Jamil Jamal is set up by a Rhodes and electric bass pulse, with slowly unfolding improvisations from Yazz's flugelhorn and bass clarinettist Shabaka Hutchings. For our friends in Paris, Yazz's ensemble will be at the [Blue Note Festival](http://www.bluenotefestival.fr/) in November.**"**

## E.M.M.A. – Cobalt
_Sanjay_: **"**There are so many reasons to love the [Burnt Sugar Arkestra](http://burntsugarindex.com/), but I may be here a while if I was to list all of them! Evolving over time into a sprawling ensemble that takes its cues from Sun Ra, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as Jimi Hendrix and electric Miles, this is their brilliant head-bopping version of the Curtis Mayfield classic, Voices.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today! Thanks to [Crewdson](http://crewdson.net/) for his selections, and [Anaïs Caura](https://vimeo.com/anaismarthecaura) for this episode's brilliant illustration.</p>
