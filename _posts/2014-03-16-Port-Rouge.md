<p id="introduction">
This morning, let's start with dreamy vibes selected by Christoph El Truento from New-Zealand. I've then spiced it up with some vitamins resulting in a colorful music story, from slow-motion sunrise on the beach to magic landscapes and islands metamorphosed into dancefloors.

# The _Cool & Smooth_ Jazzment
Three albums released on their [bandcamp page](http://url "check their bandcamp folks !") that can follow you everywhere. With calm, clarity, the dutch duo wrap you in a perfect and delightful mood. Sit snugly with a good cup of coffee and listen to this selection they're sharing with us.

# Enjoy their morning selection

## Minnie Ripperton - Only When I'm Dreaming (Jurny edit)
**"**This edit by Jurny of an old Minnie Ripperton song from 1970 is simply amazing. I find myself just drifting away while listening to these smooth and dreamy sounds. A really great edit of an old classic.**"**

## Jesper Ryom - Ghostly
**"**If you haven't heard of Jesper Ryom yet, you should definetely check him out. This is a really nice and energetic track with a simply beautiful sax sample. One of my favorite tracks from last year.**"**

## Playmodul - Null Vier B
**"**Just imagine yourself driving on an endless, empty road in the middle of the night listening to this. Close your eyes and enjoy this beautiful tune.**"**
