<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Atlanta-based music producer [Fit of Body](https://fitofbody.bandcamp.com/) to MailTape.
<br><br>
Sara has been crafting composed and improvised music for over 10 years, utilising her classically-trained voice on her compositions. Her approach touches on various musical threads, but it is not necessarily tethered to any—refracting, bending, suspending, and shifting sounds and syllables, creating a kind of linguistic limbo.</p>


# Fit of Body's selection

## C. Memi + Neo Matisse - Dream's Dream
_Fit of Body_: **"**I heard this track on a compilation called Nihon No Wave. It really stood out to me, made my ears perk up. She has a 12" titled Heavenly Peace that's really good as well.**"**

## [Love Letters](https://lovelettersmusic.bandcamp.com/releases) - Co-Locate
_Fit of Body_: **"**My friend Maxime Robillard, aka Love Letters, is about to release his new album, A Given World of Good Energy (released October 12th). This is his favorite track off the tape.**"**

## Randy Weston - Congolese Children
_Fit of Body_: **"**Unfortunately, I was not familiar with Randy Weston before he passed. The first record of his that I checked out was African Cookbook, and this track is off of that record.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Sara Serpa & André Matos – Lisboa
_Sanjay_: **"**This tune, a nod to their old haunt, is in an airy but enigmatic space for me. Sara’s atmospherics over André's spare phrasing and minimalist percussion brings that to life after a purposefully tentative start.**"**

## Cécile McLorin Salvant – You've Got to Give Me Some
_Sanjay_: **"**From her [Dreams & Daggers](https://www.cecilemclorinsalvant.com/discography/) album, Cécile brings a puckish heat to Bessie Smith’s 'You’ve Got to Give Me Some': a blues aria of sexual innuendo with some great double meanings about butchers and milkmen.**"**

## Amira Kheir – Amwaj (Waves)
_Sanjay_: **"**Amira Kheir [picked a few Sunday morning tunes for us](https://www.mailta.pe/282/amira-kheir/) back in October 2017. She has since released a new album—[Mystic Dance](http://amirakheir.com/)—and this is its opening track. Its hypnotic, mellow and steady rhythm, alongside a modestly groovy bass, melodically evoking its name.**"**

## Meeta Pandit – Thumri Pilu (Live)
_Sanjay_: **"**This thumri is a lilting raga in Pilu by the South Asian classical musician, [Meeta Pandit](http://www.meetapandit.com/), of the Gwalior Gharana. Meeta's voice stretches over an impressively wide range of over three octaves. She is also equally adept with genres of Tarana, Bhajan and Sufi, as well as cross-cultural music.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Sara Serpa](https://www.saraserpa.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
