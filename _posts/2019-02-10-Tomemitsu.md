<p id="introduction">This morning, 
<br><br>
</p>


# Tomemitsu's selection

## Sam Cooke and the soul singers - Christ is all
_Tomemitsu_: **"**Growing up I went to church just about every Sunday and what I ended up taking from that was exposure to and an appreciation for different types of music. There’s such a beauty to many voices singing together, especially ones like Sam Cooke’s. I love the organ work as well as the way the background vocals give this song dynamics and a rolling energy.**"**

## Harold Grosskopf - Synthesist
_Tomemitsu_: **"**RVNG did a nice reissue of Harold Grosskopf's album, Synthesist. This is one of my favorite tracks to play while making coffee. The Kraut beats get my motor running, and these synthesizers are heavenly. This one is really good for driving in the morning too.**"**

## Joao Gilberto - Chega de Saudade
_Tomemitsu_: **"**I had a tough time choosing my favorite Joao Gilberto song because so many are incredible. When a bunch of early JB albums were reissued on vinyl I picked up as many as I could. I have learned so much about beauty and sadness listening to him sing and trying to decipher all the lovely chords and changes. There really is such depth of emotion, but at the same time he seems to sing with a care free attitude.**"**
