<p id="introduction">This morning we are pleased to welcome a long time MailTape listener and Marseille-based vocalist, [Siêm Folknomade](https://linktr.ee/siemfolknomade).
<br><br>

In her own words, her music is 'the celebration of a nomadic folk imbued with sweet metaphors, dissolutely original and eternally ephemeral'. If you're in Marseille on 24th May, she'll be performing at [La Mesón](https://www.facebook.com/events/349829132291153/).</p>


# Siêm Folknomade's selection

## Ry x – Bound
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**Hypnotic and melancholic. A vaporous spirit that melts me deep in the heart. Love the emergency heartbeat and the silence! Love the minimalist beauty of this artist. [Ry x](https://www.ry-x.com/) has all the spirit of ubiquity and universality. That's the 'Nowhere Everywhere' songs I love. So nomadic!**"**

## [Maii Waleed](http://maiiwaleed.daportfolio.com/) – يوم الاتني
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**Meaning literally Monday in Arabic. So ambitious for a Sunday morning mood! haha. Love the rêverie of the track. I am fan of this artist and her neo-alternative musical vision. So mellow like a creamy milky kawa!**"**

## [Nonku Phiri](https://soundcloud.com/nonkuphiri) – Sîfo
_Siêm Folknomade_: **"**This ode to grief is a recent neo-electro & soulful discovery. I feel this song like a rewarding to shadow. A peaceful inner celebration. Love the life whatsoever and beyond any intuition.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Siêm Folknomade – Et Même Si
_Sanjay_: **"**Discovered at the end of 2018, I had a crush on this artist.It is by collaborating with Creestal (duo of the CM Jones group and boss of the label [Munchie Records](https://soundcloud.com/munchierecords)) or [Blanka](https://soundcloud.com/blankasanova)(member of [La Fine Equipe](https://soundcloud.com/lafineequipe)) that Elodie Rama signs his big return with the title "H O M E". A smile song illustrated with a [nice clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhtb8kqD3ec).**"**

## Emiliana Torrini – Tookah
_Sanjay_: **"**How can we not love that satin voice that caresses our bodies and tingles our hearts? His EP "Lately" released last March is an ode to the nude soul to enjoy without moderation.**"**

## Lilith Ai – Native Tongue
_Sanjay_: **"**At the beginning of this piece of music, the guitar chords are enough to make me melt of pleasure. In "Pharoah", Rosie Lowe reveals to us a lascivious voice and a sophisticated look to any proof, all in a sensual atmosphere. The title is extract from his second album ["YU"](https://soundcloud.com/rosielowe/sets/yu-202) released on May 10.**"**

## The Last Poets – If We Only Knew What We Could Do 
_Sanjay_: **"**This Nottingham singer and new signature of [the Brownswood Recordings label](https://soundcloud.com/brownswood),  transports us through her jazzy influences, r'n'b or neo soul. "Black Moon" released in 2017, is a concentrate of good mood and chill. The perfect song for a Sunday chill! **"**



<p id="outroduction"> That's it for this morning. As always thank you so much for embarking with us on our every Sunday journey! Much love and respect to [Elodie Rama](https://elodierama.fr/) for his Sunday selections, and to Anthony Dujardin for her stunning illustration.</p>
