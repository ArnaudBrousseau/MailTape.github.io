# OH MU's selection

## EleaBraaz - Lobotomie
_OH MU_: **"**I found this track by accident, and I found it super atypical, it gave me a lot of energy in the morning for months.**"**

## Fishbach - Night Bird (Petit Monstre)
_OH MU_: **"**It is because it is the first track/cover I have discovered from her 3 years ago, and I used to listen to it on repeat. At that time, I wished her career would take off, which happened 2 years later.**"**

## Wit. - INDIGOCHILD
_OH MU_: **"**I love his rap and futuristic prods, and the facvt that he talks about science fiction and reincarnation in his lyrics.**"** 


# MailTape's selection

## OH MU - La Nuit en Matin 
_Inès_: **"**I am so happy to have OH MU as a guest this morning. When I started listening to OH MU's music, I also dove right into their art at the same moment, reading their blogs and comics and xxxxx. It feels that they acquired so much strength between their previous EPs, and I love how angry the last one is, especially this song, which is why I have chosen it. XXXX.  OH MU reminds me that there is strength in vulnerability. **"**

## [Simo Soo](https://www.facebook.com/simosoo/) - Klaus 
_Inès_: **"**This one has been sitting for a while in my music, I did not think I would be ever make it part of an episode but here we go. I think it carries the same energy as Wit.'s track: acid, fast, angry, futuristic. **"**

## Claude Violante - Like That
_Inès_: **"**.**"**

## xx - xx
_Inès_: **"**xx**"**
