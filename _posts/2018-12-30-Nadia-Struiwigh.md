# Nadia Struiwigh's selection

## West Dylan Thordson – Meeting the Others
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**This is a masterpiece in my eyes (ears?). I am a big fan of soundtracks and that is why I needed to include one soundtrack which is giving me goosebumps all over. This movie included many sync stories which I like in a movie and with this soundtrack I fell in love. In this life it is hard to be the “real” yoU...and this movie reminds me how many personalities we can have, even it is setup as a Thriller. James McAvoy “The beast” plays a magnificent and crazy role in this movie. The music reminds me of an Epic hopeful emotional rollercoaster with an open end. Also...check out all the other tracks on this album.**"**

## Helios – It Was Warmer Then
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**Mostly I am into emotional pieces.. I like to listen these on a free Sunday. They make me feel warm and in balance. I like to meditate a lot and do yoga which make relieve all the stress. Helios created a balanced track which reminds me a bit of Tycho. The warm sounds with the playful rhythm that feels completely natural. It makes me happy also! The melodic string which comes in is reaching out to all my senses and makes me awake as well. **"**

## Be Forest – Totem
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**When I’ve heard this very short song for the first time...I went nuts. I truly love these kind of rhythms and the New Age sound. I grew up with the music of Enya and Pink Floyd stuff, so I love those reverby sounds. I also like the combination of electronic instruments and acoustic. I guess best of both worlds! It is very short.. but that’s making it very special and gives the feeling you want more. That is the best I think. **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Nadia Struiwigh – Roeiweijk
_Sanjay_: **"**Released just last Friday, this latest track from Zoya plays a tasteful balancing act—blending elements of American dance music and catchy lyrics with vocal melodies rooted by Indian pop music.**"**

## Kara-Lis Coverdale – Vessels
_Sanjay_: **"**At just under two minutes long this track from [Rvdical the Kid](https://soundcloud.com/rvdicalthekid/) featuring [amaarae](http://amaaraemusic.com/), with additional vocals by [EDWVN](https://soundcloud.com/edwvn), carries a dreamy and whispery vibe. The beat and her singing rise contemporaneously, her voice sliding along the rising soundscape of the song.**"**

## Roslyn Steer – Busy Window
_Sanjay_: **"**Beautiful and subdued, yet sharp as a tack. Taken from Berlin-based [mobilegirl](https://soundcloud.com/mobilegirl)'s (a.k.a. Bao-Tran Tran) first official release, 'Poise'. An EP of lilting strings, elegant arrangements and placid drums.**"**

## Grouper – Being Her Shadow
_Sanjay_: **"**Beginning and ending with fluttering xylophone sounds swaying back and forth between two tones, [Auntie Flo](https://soundcloud.com/auntie-flo/)'s remix transforms [Oumou Sangaré](https://www.instagram.com/oumou.sang/)’s original—adorned with Wassoulou instruments—into a percussion-rich, dancefloor-centric reimagination.**"**
