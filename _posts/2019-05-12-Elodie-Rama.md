# Elodie Rama's selection

## CM Jones - Remain
Elodie Rama: **"**CM Jones is a French/American duo composed of producer Creestal and emcee Moshadee. The production and vocale are classy and timeless just like the whole LP. Creestal is based in Marseille and he’s one of the first musician i met when i moved here. Now we work together, he’s my music soulmate !**"**

## Varnish La Piscine - Bubble
Elodie Rama: **"**The vibe of this tune is so funky, it makes me want to dance instantly. To me it’s a feelgood music and i like the fact that it’s sung in French. It’s quite unusual to have this style of music in French.**"**

## Témé Tan - Le Ciel 
Elodie Rama: **"**Témé Tan has this unique sound, modern and traditional at the same time. He’s a great performer and singer, i fell in love with his music a while ago. In a general matter, i'm feeling deeply connected to his music because it sounds so personal and honest. We became friends few years ago thanks to the internet and we’re family now!**"**
