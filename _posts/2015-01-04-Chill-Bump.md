# Barney Artist's morning inspiration
 
## Jordan Rakei - Add The Bassline (Nehzuil Remix)
_Barney Artist:_ **"**I'm a huge Jordan Rakei fan : really love his voice and the musicality of his songs. When I heard this Nehzuil remix of Add The Bassline lets just say it was played every Sunday from then on. Great vibes!**"**
 
## Alfa & Emmavie - Easily, I Forget
_Barney Artist:_ **"**So, I had to throw some of my musical family in the mix of this Sunday playlist. Alfa Mist and Emmavie made an incredible EP called _Epoch_ earlier this year and it was so difficult to choose just one song from it but _Easily I forget_ stands out as its melodies, instrumentation and lyrics throw you into a trance.**"**
 
## IDEH - Do Something
_Barney Artist:_ **"**This track is by a really cool new artist from London _Ideh_. This song reminds me a lot of Brandy on her _Afrodisiac_ album really love the production by V beats and the tones from Ideh. Have a listen and vibe out with me this Sunday.**"**
