#Their morning selection

## Blood Orange - You're Not Good Enough
_Pendentif:_ **"**This is the song to listen when you get out of the shower, just before joining buddies for a countryside Sunday barbecue.

##Matthewdavid - In My World
_Pendentif:_ **"**Perfect for awakening Sunday when you went to bed at 6am after a good party, in your garden, in the sun with a cup of coffee. 
You don't know if it's your brain that still spin or if it's the song.

##Rhye - 3 Days
_Pendentif:_ **"**We chose this title, but this is all the album that you need to listen.
Perfect for a chilling Sunday under the quilt with your love.
