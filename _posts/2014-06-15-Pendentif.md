<p id="introduction">
This morning, the Bordeaux-based French pop band [Pendentif](http://www.pendentifmusic.com/ "Pendentif Website") has prepared you a musical cocktail to be enjoyed without reserve...</p>

# Lifeblood pop

Lifeblood is a new pop music wave which is blasting France. Bridging charming English pop and the language of Molière, Pendentif is definitaly a strong piece of this new genra. Their compositions are full of intelligence, freshness and charm. They both combine contemporary pop malice and the tradition of great French classics.

#Their morning selection

## Blood Orange - You're Not Good Enough
_Pendentif:_ **"**This song is literally meant to be listened when you get out of the shower, right before joining your buddies on a countryside Sunday barbecue.**"**

##Matthewdavid - In My World
_Pendentif:_ **"**This track i perfect to wake up on a hangovered Sunday morning when you went to bed at 6am. No matter where you are, in your garden, under the sun or with a cup of coffee, you won’t be able to distinguish whether it’s your brain that still spin or if it’s the song.**"**

##Rhye - 3 Days
_Pendentif:_ **"**We selected this specific track, but this is the entire album that you should listen. Awesome for a chill Sunday with your sweetheart.**"**
