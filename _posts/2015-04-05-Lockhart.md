# Sous le soleil exactement

Lockhart is the solo project of Nico Lockhart; a jack-of-all-trades producer who has worked with several other artists and projects including writing and producing for Franklin's last album, remixing Odeï, My Broken Frame, Frank Rabeyrolles, [Brigitte (with Cardinale)](https://soundcloud.com/cardinale-1/i-want-your-sex-brigitte "Brigitte - Cardinale Remix on Soundcloud")...

By mixing lyrics in french and english, Lockhart is taling us stories with feet in the sand, "sous le soleil exactement" like Gainsbourg sang... After touring in solo after his first release "Toi" in March 2014!, Lockhart is working on a new album to be released soon and is setting up a live trio to share his new songs with the public.

# Lockhart's morning inspiration

## Jorge Elbrecht Feat. Ariel Pink - No Real Friend
_Lockhart:_ **"**Jorge Elbrecht released one of my favourite album of these last years, "Amoral de Violens". It was beautiful, fine and incredibly efficient. This track reflects his work very well but the presence of Ariel Pink bring this so cool "second degree"... I can't help but think of [Who's the Boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojc02OvZVo8 "Who's the boss opening theme") opening theme when I listen to it and it puts me in a good mood instantly. It goes very well with breakfast in bed...**"**

## Paradis - La Ballade de Jim
_Lockhart:_ **"**I heard Paradis for the first time thanks to my brother who sent me "the Ballad of Jim" and "Hemisphere". It was great to hear "not-so-stupid" french texts on a soft electronic music. "La ballade de Jim" makes me very nostalgic, it instantly brings me back to childhood, at night, sitting in the back seat of my parents' car, listening to music and struggling not to sleep. As comfortable as pajamas...**"**

## Only Real - Cadillac Girl
_Lockhart:_ **"**You put this song in your HiFi thing in the morning and you become a cool guy. It lasts for the day, nothing can stop you, and nothing become a problem. I know very little about Only Real but this track is perfect. This cultivated nonchalance, and the guitar that opens the song ... It's the sun that comes to wake you up in person in the scorching humidity of summer.**"**
