<p id="introduction">This Morning, we board to a new year full of joy and love...  but mainly full of music discoveries and hearing gems! This trip, with Cam Maclean as our Captain, promises to be filed of hope and sweetness to spend a good sunday. 
Cam MacLean is born in Montreal and he's one of the Vesuvio Solo's two members. In love with melancholic indie-pop music, I was enthralled by this songwriter's ballads —sometimes under the infuence of the 80's.</p>


# Cam Maclean's selection

## [West Dylan Thordson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Dylan_Thordson) – Meeting the Others
_Cam Maclean_: **"** Cadence Weapon - Five Roses feat Blue Hawaii

This song by my friend Cadence Weapon is the most mellow track from the self-titled record he released this year, and great for Sunday morning listening. It is, among other things, a tribute to other artists like him who are originally from Alberta but who became integral parts of the music scene in Montreal. It features a stunning vocal performance by Raphaelle from Blue Hawaii (herself an Alberta expat in Montreal). My own Montreal neighbourhood of Outremont is also referenced here.

Jessica Pratt - Moon Dude

I've always been into folk and acoustic music that's eccentric in terms of production and performance, and in particular that is centred around a strange or unique vocal. I think Jessica Pratt is of the tradition of singers like John Jacob Niles and Karen Dalton whose unique voices helped expand simple acoustic songs far beyond their cores. Moon Dude really showcases the unique timbre of J.P.'s voice, as well as her strange delivery.

Bonny Doon - I am Here (I am alive)

I have been into this band since sharing the stage with them in Detroit in 2015 when I was touring with Vesuvio Solo. This song has a kind of nihilistic resignation, but with a certain humour I like that comes through in lines like, "smoke from palo santo and sage, is this the new age or am I too late?" I have been on an alt-country kick lately, and this one has been on repeat for the past while.**"**

## Helios – It Was Warmer Then
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**Mostly I am into emotional pieces... I like to listen to these on a free Sunday. They make me feel warm and in balance. I like to meditate a lot and do yoga which relieves all the stress. [Helios](https://www.unseen-music.com/) created a balanced track which reminds me a bit of [Tycho](http://tychomusic.com/). The warm sounds with the playful rhythm that feels completely natural. It makes me happy also! The melodic string which comes in is reaching out to all my senses and makes me awake as well.**"**

## [Be Forest](https://beforest.bandcamp.com/) – Totem
_Nadia Struiwigh_: **"**When I heard this very short song for the first time...I went nuts. I truly love these kind of rhythms and the New Age sound. I grew up with the music of Enya and Pink Floyd stuff, so I love those reverby sounds. I also like the combination of electronic instruments and acoustic. I guess best of both worlds! It is very short...but that’s making it very special and gives the feeling you want more. That is the best I think.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Nadia Struiwigh – Roeiweijk
_Anaïs G_: **"**Lovely downtempo and ambient vibes from today's guest, [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/). Flirting with ambient techno, the drones and spaced out pads work well in slow, drawn out movements here.**"**

## Kara-Lis Coverdale – Vessels
_Anaïs G_: **"**Uncompromisingly distinct while flickering with gentle optimism, this triptych for solo piano—written, performed and recorded by [Kara-Lis Coverdale](https://soundcloud.com/klissay)—illuminates unseen spaces that eventually gradient into nothingness.**"**

## Roslyn Steer – Busy Window
_Anaïs G_: **"**I don't know a great deal about [Roslyn Steer](https://soundcloud.com/ros-steer)'s musical output, but this sounds like yet another welcome discovery from the ethereal contemporary music scene in Ireland.**"**

## Grouper – Being Her Shadow
_Anaïs G_: **"**This track has all the things I've come to associate with [Grouper](http://www.repeatingpattern.com/), the solo project of musician Liz Harris: impressionistic, slightly 'out of focus' and replete with comfortingly indecipherable lyrics. Ultimately losing itself in a drifting, idyllic soundworld.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning and this year. As always thanks so much for listening to this episode, and to all our previous episodes in 2018. Much love and respect to [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/) for her Sunday selections today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration. Have a great new year!</p>
