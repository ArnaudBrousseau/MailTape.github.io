<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome multi-instrumentalist composer and historian of electronic music and sound, Dr. Tara Rodgers ([Analog Tara](http://www.analogtara.net/wp/)). 
<br><br>
Over the last 20 years, Tara has studied with sonic experimentalists [Maggi Payne](https://sites.google.com/site/maggipayne/), [Fred Frith](http://www.fredfrith.com/) and [Pauline Oliveros](https://paulineoliveros.us/). She’s self-released six LPs and six EPs of electronic music, and she’s also got tracks on Move D's Source Records and the Le Tigre Remix 12”.
<br><br>
Once a website and now a book, her project [Pink Noise](http://www.analogtara.net/wp/projects/pink-noises/) has catalogued the work and presence of women in electronic music. In her own music, from analogue techno to generative sound installations made with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), Tara has performed around the U.S. and internationally.</p>


# Analog Tara's selection

## Sarah Vaughan – Autumn Leaves
_Analog Tara_: **"**At my place on weekends, there is usually jazz on the turntable from [Pablo Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Records), music I grew up with and stay close to. “Autumn Leaves” is a track from [Sarah Vaughan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Vaughan)’s 1982 album, “Crazy and Mixed Up,” with Joe Pass on guitar and Roland Hanna on piano. It’s a stunning vocal performance, virtuosic and inventive. I also admire that Vaughan delivered this performance 40 years into her career on an album for which she was also the produ**"**

## Moodymann – Sunday Morning
_Analog Tara_: **"**I’m always following the pathways of jazz in and out of house music and techno, and of course many roads lead through Detroit. I’ve long been a fan of [Moodymann](http://www.mahoganimusic.com/)’s music, for his ear for layering instrumental performances and loops. He’ll also fold in atmospheric sounds, like a reminder that this music lives and breathes in social contexts - a refreshing contrast to some more sterile treatments of sounds in a lot of house and techno. And because your mailing list is meant for Sunday morning… here is “Sunday morning” from a 1998 12” on [Planet E](https://planet-e.net/).**"**

## Spiral Deluxe – The Paris Roulette 
_Analog Tara_: **"**[Jeff Mills](https://twitter.com/DJJeffMills) is masterful with the TR-909 and it’s exciting to hear him stretch those chops in another direction for this new electronic jazz collaboration. Really enjoying the keyboard and synth work from [Gerald Mitchell](https://www.discogs.com/artist/10841-Gerald-Mitchell) and [Yumiko Ohno](https://www.instagram.com/yumikoohno/) as well. Hoping they come through here on tour!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Analog Tara – Pulse and Light
_Sanjay_: **"**Lovely downtempo and ambient vibes from today's guest, [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/). Flirting with ambient techno, the drones and spaced out pads work well in slow, drawn out movements here.**"**

## Dawn of Midi – Algol
_Sanjay_: **"**Uncompromisingly distinct while flickering with gentle optimism, this triptych for solo piano—written, performed and recorded by [Kara-Lis Coverdale](https://soundcloud.com/klissay)—illuminates unseen spaces that eventually gradient into nothingness.**"**

## Jlin – Blue i
_Sanjay_: **"**I don't know a great deal about [Roslyn Steer](https://soundcloud.com/ros-steer)'s musical output, but this sounds like yet another welcome discovery from the ethereal contemporary music scene in Ireland.**"**

## Moor Mother – Time Floats (King Britt Remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**This track has all the things I've come to associate with [Grouper](http://www.repeatingpattern.com/), the solo project of musician Liz Harris: impressionistic, slightly 'out of focus' and replete with comfortingly indecipherable lyrics. Ultimately losing itself in a drifting, idyllic soundworld.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning and this year. As always thanks so much for listening to this episode, and to all our previous episodes in 2018. Much love and respect to [Nadia Struiwigh](https://www.nadiastruiwigh.com/) for her Sunday selections today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](https://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration. Have a great new year!</p>
