<p id="introduction">This morning, dsdssds.</p>


# **Yellow Days' selection**

+ ## Chelsea Wolfe - After The Fall
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning with something equal parts soothing and sinister? 'After The Fall' is a powerful song, the shattering wall of sound behind the soaring vocals of the chorus bit knocks me off my feet every time. A great artist, Chelsea Wolfe stands apart from her contemporaries, and this song is one of her best. This song will wake you up for sure.**"**

+ ## Patty Griffin - Ohio
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning with a song that carries you out of your Sunday morning slumber? 'Ohio' is a carefully constructed song with its strength in melody and subtlety. A gleaming gem from her somewhat overlooked latter-career masterpiece 'American Kid'.**"**

+ ## The Tammys - Egyptian Shumba
_TRAAMS_: **"**Why not kick off the morning by just dancing loads? Simply one of the greatest Pop songs ever recorded, pure joy in melody and rhythm. The Egyptian Shumba will ensure your Sunday is a stonker.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## TRAAMS - Low
_ImaCrea_: **"**I really like the spirit stemming from TRAAMS’ songs. The bass! The heaviness! The shouting! The guitar! I have listened to ‘Low’ a lot after seeing them live in Paris last March. On another note, I strongly suggest you check out '[A House on Fire](https://soundcloud.com/fatcatrecords/traams-a-house-on-fire)' (another favorite of mine) for 8 minutes of raw energetic fuzzy guitar madness.**"**  

+ ## Lone Taxidermist - Mr Coral
_ImaCrea_: **"**Let’s go into spooky mode for a bit now. I discovered Lone Taxidermist by accident very recently, just because I got intrigued by their album cover. It turned out to be a very cool eerie pop album, with songs made up of weird little pieces that almost assemble, always having a little something off about them, but still ending up being an amazing package. There it is, with insanely good vocals.**"**

+ ## Shannon and the Clams - Troublemaker
_ImaCrea_: **"**The 60s vibe on The Tammys’ song chosen by TRAAMS reminded me of Shannon and the Clams, a band I have been listening to for years. Listening to them always makes me go into « heart-shaped eyes » mode. They’re half punk, half cute, overall just amazing, and ’Troublemaker’ is one of the many songs I could have picked for this episode.**"**

+ ## Alex Cameron - Country Figs
_ImaCrea_: **"**I’ve been obsessed with Alex Cameron ever since I discovered his first album, which I have been listening to on repeat for almost a year. He has released his second album, 'Forced Witness’, a few days ago, and ‘Country Figs’ is one of the best and catchiest songs from it.**"**
