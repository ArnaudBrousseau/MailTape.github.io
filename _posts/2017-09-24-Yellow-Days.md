<p id="introduction">This morning, we keep it smooth and easy with this delicate indie selection made with the young and talended Yellow Days. Autumn just started 3 days ago, let’s stay in bed a little longer and plan our next vacation... </p>

# Electro I love you but sometimes...
... you’re dragging me down. Your synth and loops are great to make me fly high and dance till the next day but as winter approaches I need some warmth and the gentle riffs of a guitar call my soul much easier in this atmosphere. 

Yellow Days’ music has been my obsession for a few months now when I need that kind of comfortable space in my head. I’ve been waiting for weeks to share this episode with you, looking for a perfectly balanced selection. Here’s to you, hopefully you’ll find in it as much, if not more, inspiration than myself.

# **Yellow Days' selection**

+ ## Run DMT - Romantic
_Yellow Days_: **"**Beautiful guitar tones, enough soul for a sunday morning cry.**"**

+ ## Aldous RH - U and ME
_Yellow Days_: **"**For me the sound is so smooth it makes my knees weak and that's a nice way to start a sunday.**"**

+ ## Made in M - Goodday
_Yellow Days_: **"**Lil' lo-fi cube sample, real tight beat. an easy listen for an easy sunday.**"**


# MailTape's selection

+ ## Yellow Days - Hurt In Love
_ImaCrea_: **"**Right to the heart. Track after each track, Yellow Days keeps exploring a rich soundscape driven by pure emotion.**"**  

+ ## Oliverpalfreyman - Females
_ImaCrea_: **"**Slow down, keep it cool this morning. This one is for you to stay one more track in your comfy bed in these early days of Autumn.**"**

+ ## Mattiel - Count Your Blessings
_ImaCrea_: **"**Instantly memorable, reminiscence of Nancy Sinatra. Gosh I love so much Burger Records...**"**

+ ## Amber Cruz - Psychedelic Candy
_ImaCrea_: **"**Rare gem I discovered by chance on a late night. Couldn't discern if I was dreaming or if this angel voice was really coming from my speakers. Smooth and delicate voice. Direct connection to the soul.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Many thanks to Yellow Days for his collaboration. Have an inspiring Sunday, make your dreams come true!</p>
