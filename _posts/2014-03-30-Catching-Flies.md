<p id="introduction">
This morning, we're going to remind you that sometimes it's important to swap your coffee with a beer ! Go out, buy a ticket for a concert and if you're lucky enough, you'll make some cool discoveries as for us with Catching Flies.</p>

# From a live session... 
We asked few people around us, no one seemed to know him but everyone was looking at each other asking **"**Who's that guy, that's sweet !**"**.  Peacefully, he did an impressive live. If you come across him, we highly recommend ! 

# ... To a morning selection

## Mark McGuire - In Search Of The Miraculous
**"**Wicked track, a perfect start to Sunday mornings. The tune is produced by Floating Points... Floating points & Fatima = Killer combo! Check out the EP he produced for her called **‘**Follow You.**’****"**

## Nils Frahm - Me
**"**In my mind, Sundays are meant to be slower days.  Whether that means it's a day to sleep in late, or take a nap in the afternoon, or just spend some time reflecting on the week that's passed.  Nils Frahm has provided the quiet music that's so necessary in these times of reflection.**"**

## Bibio - Down To The Sound
**"**I think this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.**"**

That's all folks! A big thank to [Teen Daze](https://soundcloud.com/teendaze) for their selection. Thanks for listening. Enjoy your sunday!
