<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Yorkshire-based band, [Fold](http://fold.fm/), as they invite you to travel, reflect and jive in collaboration with MailTape.</p>
<p>Weaving a tapestry of speaking and singing voices from past and present into funk, jazz, soul and psyche, Fold remind us of the forces within that matter most.</p>


# Oiseaux-Tempête's selection



## Lichens – Heilagur Draugur
_Frédéric Oberland_: **"**OK, it's Sunday morning, you can live it slowly. Keep shutting your eyes and start to enjoy one of the most beautiful tracks ever by the always-amazing Robert Lowe. Layers and layers of vocal tracks like little rays from the sun penetrating your mind. Eventually you will find yourself in the middle of the song making a coffee, then make your body warmer with the first light from outside. I got so huge memories related to this track, like a Sunday morning on a terrace in Beirut with Stéphane and the two Grégoire from As Human Pattern, listening to this one all together, half-sleepy/half-awake. **"**

## Nine Inch Nails – 28 Ghosts IV
_Frédéric Oberland_: **"**Every Sunday morning brings its share of memories and a bit of nostalgia. Seems like this kind of unknown track from Trent Reznor fulfills this purpose!**"**

## Sarathy Korwar – Bismillah
_Frédéric Oberland_: **"**An exquisite blend of textures and rhythms mixing Indian and African spirit with electric free-jazz and gentle electronics. Take the soul of Don Cherry, the vibrations of the spiritual songs, the groove from the desert blues, the cyclical trance of Indian classical music, the craziness from the soft side of Electric Masada and shake everything together. This is some perfect crossing cultures smoothie to celebrate your day of the sun.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Oiseaux-Tempête – I Don't Know, What Or Why (Mish Aaref Eish W Leish) (ft. Tamer Abu Ghazaleh)
_Sanjay_: **"**Seth, Kane, Ben and Sam of [Fold](http://fold.fm/) pack a lot into their sound. If the driving basslines and spirited drumming don't encourage you to at least shuffle your feet, the spoken word samples may impel you to reflect on the socio-political commentary—recurrent in most of Fold's music. On this track, the spoken word samples are from [Walter “Tangle Eye” Jackson](https://www.discogs.com/artist/2678688-Walter-Tangle-Eye-Jackson), an African American prisoner in Mississippi recorded in 1947, [Fred Hampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton), [Lorraine Hansberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine_Hansberry) and a section of a poem by [Margaret Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Walker).**"**

## Christina Vantzou – Laurie Spiegel
_Sanjay_: **"**[This Brighton-based trio](https://soundcloud.com/velstrio) are making some really nice groove-laden music right now. In this title track, the off-kilter breakbeat-style groove is counterposed with mercurial keys and a floating bassline with just enough groove to get a boogie on...if Seth's choices haven't already got you doing just that.**"**

## Nadah El Shazly – Barzakh
_Sanjay_: **"**It was pretty hard standing still when I first saw [Stella Chiweshe](http://www.stellachiweshe.com/) playing her mbira at Cafe OTO in London this year. The mbira is a percussion instrument capable of playing two melodic lines at the same time. This track (translated: laugh about it) from the brilliant 'Talking Mbira' album continues the jive this morning with its give-and-go vocal lines and high-life upbeatness.**"**

## Jerusalem In My Heart – 7ebr El 3oyoun
_Sanjay_: **"**Backed by the United States, which opposed Allende's socialist policies—land redistribution, nationalisation of major corporations (especially the US-owned copper holdings that accounted for 80% of the country's foreign earnings), and a radical re-orientation of health, education and housing services—the Chilean right wing staged a coup d'état on September 11, 1973, resulting in the death of Allende and the installation of the CIA/corporate America-backed Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. On the morning of 12 September 1973, Víctor Jara was taken prisoner, along with thousands of others, and detained in Chile Stadium. After torturing him, the guards mockingly asked him to play guitar and sing for his fellow prisoners. Soon after, he was killed by a gunshot wound to the head, and his body was covered with more than 40 bullets. Electoral registers had been pulped, the Chilean TUC banned and collective bargaining made illegal. Almost alone among European nations, Britain refused shelter in its Santiago embassy to all but UK nationals.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Thanks so much for listening and much gratitude to Seth (as well as Kane, Ben and Sam of [Fold](http://fold.fm/)) for being our guest(s), and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for this episode's colourful illustration!</p>
