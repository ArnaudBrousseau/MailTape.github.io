# Mahalia's selection


## Maxwell — Ascension
_Mahalia_: **"**It was a song that I used to hear in the house when I was younger. I think my parents used to play it. I found it on Spotify recently and thought : « Oh my god, I know this song! ». I just remember being a kid, running around, singing it with my parents. So I think I listen to that a lot because it’s kind of nostalgic.**"**

## Russ — Scared
_Mahalia_: **"**Russ is an artist from the US, I really love. He pulled out an album last year and I hadn’t heard that one song. It’s just one of my favorites right now, so I just say to everyone to listen to it. It’s really beautiful.**"**

## Bakar — All in
_Mahalia_: **"**Bakar has got a British accent and this song is kind of fun. It has fun lyrics and it feels really happy. For me, at the moment, I feel like a lot of music isn’t really hitting that spot. A lot a music is kind of moody, I can sing to it or dance to it, but nothing is giving me that genuine happiness that I used to get from music when I was a kid**"**
