# Yazz Ahmed's selection



## Sarathy Korwar – Bismillah
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I love Sarathy’s playing and compositions and his choice of musicians. This track, to me, feels like an invitation to enter a beautiful spiritual place.
The opening is like a simple morning prayer which develops and intensifies into a celebration. We are waking, moving and dancing into the new day.**"**

## Samuel Hällkvist – Variety Of Rhythm Part 4: "The Necker Cube”
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I’ve been a fan of Samuel and his music ever since we met, back in 2012.
This angular, precisely metric and intriguing piece is very typical of Samuel’s compositions: mysterious, menacing and fun. I like the contasting elements, the broken drum beats, floating on a bed of sonorous guitar, decorated with vibraphone and violin interjections. It reminds me of an impressionist painting. Then, in the middle of the piece, the sun rises and the pace starts to quicken. The rhythmic constraints are broken with an overwhelming surge of expressive freedom.**"**

## Ruth Wall – Snow Clamp
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**A collaboration between harpist, Ruth Wall, and composer Graham Fitkin—both musicians and composers I greatly admire. This piece beautifully integrates electronic effects with the elegant sounds of the harp. It starts very gently, with a thoughtful mediation, then progresses with increasing momentum by the addition of reversed loops and clouds of processed drums. It makes me feel that I’m falling, tumbling, running, in a dream, then with a sudden stop… awake!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Yazz Ahmed — La Saboteuse
_Sanjay_: **"**It's not often we get to present the work of poets on MailTape, but I'm glad we are! Conveying mixed emotions of hope and fear, this composition from Cassie Kinoshi makes me want to curl up in an armchair and read more [Langston Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes)...'away from the too-rough fingers of the world'.**"**

## Mazz Swift – Invisible (Dedicated to Trayvon Martin and his Family)
_Sanjay_: **"**Dedicated to Trayvon Martin and his family, this is Mazz Swift's contribution to the first CD release from Con Vivo Music, '[Modern Dances](https://soundcloud.com/convivomusic/sets/modern-dances)', featuring music by their members. I saw Mazz perform last Sunday with [Hear in Now](http://www.hearinnow.com/) at The Vortex in London alongside Tomeka Reid, Silvia Bolognesi and Alexander Hawkins. So good!**"**

## Collocutor — Arrival
_Sanjay_: **"**This track is taken from the second album by [Collocutor](https://collocutor.uk/), a London-based ensemble led by saxophonist [Tamar Osborn](https://tamarosborn.com/). This is beautiful modal music ranging from afrobeat to polyphonic choral music. The entire EP resonates with some really nice brass arrangements combined with ethereal solos. Perfect for the onset of autumn.**"**

## Moses Boyd Exodus — Nocturne
_Sanjay_: **"**I feel there's a lot more music to come from [Moses Boyd](http://www.mosesboyd.co.uk/) & Co. and it's been a pretty exciting experience hearing them live every time I've had the opportunity. While evocative of the night, I think this works just as well for a (very early?) Sunday morning!**"**
