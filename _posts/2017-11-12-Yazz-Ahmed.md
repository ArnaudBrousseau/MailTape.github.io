<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to collaborate with trumpeter and composer [Yazz Ahmed](http://yazzahmed.com/) and get a glimpse into her Sunday morning jukebox with MailTape.</p>
<p>As well as leading her own quartet and septet, Yazz has also recorded and performed with Radiohead, Max Romeo, Lee ‘Scratch’ Perry, ABC, Swing Out Sister, Joan as Police Woman and Amel Zen.</p>
<p>For our friends in Paris and London, Yazz will be performing with the Hafla Band at the [Blue Note Festival](http://www.bluenotefestival.fr/) on 16th November and at [King's Place](http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/music/yazz-ahmed-la-saboteuse#.WgbNH7CFjfY) in London on the 17th.</p>


# Yazz Ahmed's selection



## Sarathy Korwar – Bismillah
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I love [Sarathy](http://www.sarathykorwar.com/)’s playing and compositions and his choice of musicians. This track, to me, feels like an invitation to enter a beautiful spiritual place. The opening is like a simple morning prayer which develops and intensifies into a celebration. We are waking, moving and dancing into the new day.**"**

## Samuel Hällkvist – Variety Of Rhythm Part 4: "The Necker Cube”
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**I’ve been a fan of [Samuel](http://samuelhallkvist.com/) and his music ever since we met, back in 2012. This angular, precisely metric and intriguing piece is very typical of Samuel’s compositions: mysterious, menacing and fun. I like the contasting elements, the broken drum beats, floating on a bed of sonorous guitar, decorated with vibraphone and violin interjections. It reminds me of an impressionist painting. Then, in the middle of the piece, the sun rises and the pace starts to quicken. The rhythmic constraints are broken with an overwhelming surge of expressive freedom.**"**

## Ruth Wall – Snow Clamp
_Yazz Ahmed_: **"**A collaboration between harpist, [Ruth Wall](http://sound-scotland.co.uk/profile/wall-ruth), and composer [Graham Fitkin](http://fitkin.com/)—both musicians and composers I greatly admire. This piece beautifully integrates electronic effects with the elegant sounds of the harp. It starts very gently, with a thoughtful mediation, then progresses with increasing momentum by the addition of reversed loops and clouds of processed drums. It makes me feel that I’m falling, tumbling, running, in a dream, then with a sudden stop… awake!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Yazz Ahmed — La Saboteuse
_Sanjay_: **"**It's pretty difficult for me to pick just one track from Yazz's latest album, 'La Saboteuse', as the whole piece feels cinematic in its storytelling. Nonetheless, in this crepuscular title track my thoughts are given the time and space to float freely amid the quiet bass clarinet and gentle percussion—perfect for a dewy Sunday morning.**"**

## Fran & Flora – The Hollow Tree
_Sanjay_: **"**As well as their soulful laments and meticulous songs, the first time I saw [Fran & Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/) in London we were treated to a Romani accapella sung in harmony following tales of their musical adventures in Eastern Europe. I'm looking forward to their debut album soon, such a cool duo!**"**

## Zoe Rahman — Shiraz
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from pianist Zoe Rahman.**"**

## Vijay Iyer — Break Stuff
_Sanjay_: **"**I feel there's a lot more music to come from [Moses Boyd](http://www.mosesboyd.co.uk/) & Co. and it's been a pretty exciting experience hearing them live every time I've had the opportunity. While evocative of the night, I think this works just as well for a (very early?) Sunday morning!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for today. Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Yazz Ahmed](http://yazzahmed.com/) for being our guest, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
