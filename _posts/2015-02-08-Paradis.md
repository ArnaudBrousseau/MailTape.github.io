<p id="introduction">Paradis is french for Paradise. Why paradis? Paradis is a ideal of hapiness. A place where, what we do, what we say and what we produce stay true to our sensibilities. This is what led [Paradis](https://soundcloud.com/paradisfm "Paradis's SoundCloud") to make music. They refeer to their music as the music they've would have liked to listen to.</p>


# Idealistic music for idealistic people

Paradis is a duo of two young french men. They have met at a party. They were making musing on their own but a little later decided to form Paradis. Two years ago, heir track [La Ballade de Jim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB0h-PDoRYM) released on [Beats In Space](http://www.beatsinspace.net) received many compliments. They have just released their EP [Couleurs Primaires](http://po.st/CouleursPrimairesiTunes), which is a first sight at what their upcoming debut album will be made of. But their universe is not only music. You should definately check out their viedo clips [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWhR0RMcdfw), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCmnx-e928k), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OkN1m4AgIY) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-8cZ6Vf2WY). Enjoy !

# Paradis’s morning inspiration
 
## Denis Sulta - A.A.L.A.S
_Paradis:_ **"**At the moment we’re starting all of our sets with this one! It’s just too hard to resist! We love the way it confronts sweet soul vocals with tough club beats.**"**
 
## Harvey Sutherland - Oscillate
_Paradis:_ **"**Our second track comes from a new record by Harvey Sutherland. His sound palette is beautiful on all the tracks from this record. Usually we buy a record for a particular track, it’s pretty rare for us to find one that we like from start to finish!**"**
 
## Secret Circuit - Foggy Twilights
_Paradis:_ **"**And last but not least, a short and effective summer anthem from Secret Circuit, who also released music on Beats In Space. Did someone say cocktails ?**"**

Enjoy your sunday.
