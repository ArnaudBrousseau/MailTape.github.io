<p id="introduction">Is this Paradise? I have no idea. Never been there. Looks a lot more like hell here though. And, to be fully honest with you this is what [Paradis](https://soundcloud.com/paradisfm "Paradis's SoundCloud") is all about. Mixing with high tempo hellish beats with foggy french lyrics. Kind of a cross over in between you mum's music and nowadays vibes. In other words, past and present reunited in .<p>

# Made a discovery yet?

After having made this discovery, we realized that it is easier to say that this never-ending loop of discovery is what advances us in every little step of ours while we do our best to unravel the truth that discoveries are not only important but quintessential to our existence.  With that said, We hope you come to our site this Sunday and discover Anenon. Enjoy !

# Paradis’s morning inspiration
 
## Denis Sulta - A.A.L.A.S
_Paradis:_ **"**At the moment we’re starting all of our sets with this one! It’s just too hard to resist! We love the way it confronts sweet soul vocals with tough club beats.**"**
 
## Harvey Sutherland - Oscillate
_Paradis:_ **"**Our second track comes from a new record by Harvey Sutherland. His sound palette is beautiful on all the tracks from this record. Usually we buy a record for a particular track, it’s pretty rare for us to find one that we like from start to finish!**"**
 
## Secret Circuit - Foggy Twilights
_Paradis:_ **"**And last but not least, a short and effective summer anthem from Secret Circuit, who also released music on Beats In Space. Did someone say cocktails ?**"** 
 
<p id="outroduction">
That’s all folks! A big thank to our guest [Paradis](https://soundcloud.com/paradisfm "Paradis's SoundCloud") and his morning selection. And a warm thank you to Caroline Seroussi for her new monthly donation.
Enjoy your sunday.
