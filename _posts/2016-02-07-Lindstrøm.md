<p id="introduction">This morning, fly off from the Scandinavian Arctic towards space. We head to the mysterious new planet in our solar system. Yet unnamed , I solemnly proposes to name this one in tribute to the man who had perhaps discovered it before anyone else : Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. His work talk about Kingdoms ruled by the ARP-2600 and gods even stronger than Nordic Pantheon. I'm sure he talk about the ninth planet of our solar system.</p>

# Disco Viking

As his friends Todd Terje. Lindstrom excel in Spatial Nu-Disco. And think all his songs as an electronic symphony

# Lindstrøm's spatial selection
 
## Oma & Amberflame - Lazy Sun
Hans-Peter Lindstrøm: **"** Great harp-drenched version of the 2007 AN-2 summertime anthem to extend your summer!**"**

## Michael David - Ohana
H-P L.:**"**Totally awesome balearic spacey 80-s boogie track from Michael David of LA Classixx. Nice bouncy bass and dx-keys!**"**

## Crackazat - Eye Light
Nicholas: **"** Amazing track from a band I know nothing about. Jazz-soul chords with a nice swing makes this a no-brainer**“**
