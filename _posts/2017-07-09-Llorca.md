## A New Post

<p id="introduction">This morning, [WUMAN](https://www.facebook.com/wumanband/ "Facebook")'s selection makes us travel through time, to the past and to great memories, for a wholesome and chill Sunday. </p>
<p>Self-described as female music composed by male humans, [WUMAN](https://www.facebook.com/wumanband/ "Facebook") creates sound portraits about women, with video projections when playing live. A multi-dimensional project, where each song is a story about a new _wuman_.</p>


# **WUMAN's selection**

+ ## Mort Garson - Plantasia
_Nico from WUMAN_: **"**Because it makes me think of Sunday mornings in my grandmother's living room when I was a kid: Cobra, Albator and toasts with white chocolate.**"**

+ ## Black Flower - Upwards
_Marin from WUMAN_: **"**Because ethiobeat makes you want to cook and that on Sundays, you have the time to cook.**"**

+ ## GUTS - Come Closer
_Rey from WUMAN_: **"**It's the end of weekend track, when you partied on Saturday and that you are in an altered state the day after, so you do nothing serious all day, except a barbecue-Tarot by a lake with your friends, the end of afternoon sunlight shining on your neck, you feel just right.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## WUMAN - Alice
_Inès_: **"**"Alice" is taken from WUMAN's first EP [Portraits](https://wumanband.bandcamp.com/ "EP"). Listening to it feels like hearing a story developing right before your ears: starting out quite lightly, it gets more and more intense as it goes, until reaching this kind of urgency at the end, leaving you curious about what's happening next.**"** 

+ ## Marius Atherton — Partie De Campagne
_Inès_: **"**As stated in this song's description on Soundcloud, it is "the wonderful story of a Sunday in the 19th century". A depiction of a picnic, a story about the little _bourgeoisie_, an ironic bliss?**"**

+ ## Forever Pavot - Le Passeur d'Armes
_Inès_: **"**Forever Pavot is a French artist who released _Rhapsode_, his brilliant first album, a few years ago. "Le Passeur d'Armes" is my favorite song from it: a sexy, arrhythmic, epic track. Perfect when you want to feel motivated, yet also perfect to chill out.**"**

+ ## Blisss - Fai Yen
_Inès_: **"**Sampled from a Thai song by Ream Daranoi, "Fai Yen" is an electro hip-hop rendition of the original track. A cool song to relax to on Sundays.**"**
