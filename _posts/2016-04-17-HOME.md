<p id="introduction">This morning, we're lucky to have the mysterious [Randy Goffe a.k.a HOME](https://www.facebook.com/homemusicofficial/) as our guest. Coming from Florida, his retro-futuristic sound is on its way to invade brains all over the world. Kaleidoscopic beats, japanese psyche-rock, vintage synths, and much more... Let's fly.</p>

# HOME's selection:

## Homeshake - Faded
_HOME_: "I've been a huge fan of this guy for almost a year now, I fell in love with his first full length In The Shower when I was finishing up my second album towards the end of 2014, and it's followup Midnight Snack is a really cool step in a slightly more electronic direction. Really wavy R&B influenced stuff with a lot of cheesy synths. Perfect soundtrack for lying in bed on your phone for half an hour before finally deciding to get up."

## Chrome Sparks - Lost In The Chrome Forest
_HOME_: "This track is one of my favorites, really simple synth sounds and a cool hook, very dreamy."

## A.K. Paul - Landcruisin'
_HOME_: "I was so stoked when I saw this track a few days ago, I've been waiting for new Jai Paul for ages and I guess his brother would be the next best thing I could ask for. Really wonky, disjointed sound, cool synths and drums. I had it on in the background this morning while I was setting up to record some demos."
