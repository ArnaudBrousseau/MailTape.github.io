rument that has traditionally been considered unsuitable for South Asian classical music, and often referred to as the ‘Raga Pianist’, Utsav’s handling of a raga blends his diverse musical influences. Ranging from the Persian piano playing tradition of Morteza Mahjoobi, the genre-bending piano playing of Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou and extended techniques of Helmut Lachenmann.

Performing on a completely acoustic grand piano allows Utsav to alter the individual frequencies of each note through a slider that varies the string tension. This makes the microtones much more accessible and the note can be bent and altered once played.</p>

_Utsav Lal_: **"**This is currently my favorite record to listen to when I wake up. I'm obsessed with musicians who develop very unique personal voices on their instruments particularly when it is a direct result of their background. She has such an incredibly personal way of approaching the piano which reflects her intense and vivid life story. As an Ethiopian nun who was an Italian prisoner of war and had to flee Ethiopia multiple times during her life to Jerusalem amongst many other places, her music really reflects a deep and unique culmination of all these facets. As pianist and composer, her use of decay, systems of organization is fascinating. It also just really makes me happy when I listen to the record. I chose the first piece and it's how I've started most of my mornings in the past few weeks and they're incredible gems. **"**
