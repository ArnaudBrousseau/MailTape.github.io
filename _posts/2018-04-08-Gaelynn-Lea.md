<p id="introduction">Based in Strasbourg and only one of a tiny handful of performers on the ondes Martenot, this Sunday morning we welcome [Christine Ott](http://www.christineott.fr/) to collaborate with us on MailTape.</p>
<p>Toying with mood and tone with practiced ease in her own work, Christine has also been an integral part of Yann Tiersen's band and has collaborated with the likes of Radiohead, Tindersticks, Syd Matters, Daau, Raphelson, Noir Désir, Vénus, Oiseaux-Tempête and Foudre! over the past two decades.</p>


# Gaelynn Lea's selection


## Jerree Small – 60 Words For Water
_Gaelynn Lea_: **"**The perfect Sunday morning song to me is upbeat but not too rocking, and also not too sappy. It should leave you feeling calm, happy, refreshed and with the desire to press "repeat"... 60 Words for Water is all of these things to me. Jerree Small is a musician from my hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, and I absolutely love her songwriting and her vocals... I hope she keeps making music forever.**"**

## The Decemberists – Angel, Won't You Call Me?
_Gaelynn Lea_: **"**When I was in college I was a die-hard Decemberists fan - in fact, I attribute my love of lyrics to Colin Meloy's songwriting. This track is from their first-ever release called "5 songs" that came out in 2001. I just think it's such a light-hearted, easy-breezy song and I would love to wake up to it on a Sunday morning.**"**

## Charliee Parr – Gospel Plow
_Gaelynn Lea_: **"**My hometown has a small but incredibly vibrant music scene that I didn't really know existed while I was growing up. But I DID know about Charlie Parr. He's this amazing blues/roots/country artist from Duluth who has subsequently gone on to tour all over the world.   He is incredibly talented and also just one of the kindest, gentlest people you'll ever meet. This is one of his more upbeat songs and the gospel vibe makes it a good song to wake up to on a Sunday morning!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Gaelynn Lea – Bound By A Thread
_Sanjay_: **"**'Szczecin' is taken from Christine Ott's 2016 solo album, [Only Silence Remains](http://www.gizehrecords.com/gzh66-christine-ott-only-silence-remains.html). Like Szczecin, the album is a subtly-sketched melodic recording, with the arrangements given ample space as Christine performs on a variety of instruments throughout the record.**"**

## Diane Cluck – Sara
_Sanjay_: **"**[Chris](http://chrislittleboat.tumblr.com/) is a musician based in Bristol, UK, working as a composer, performer and sound designer with [The Paper Cinema](http://www.thepapercinema.com/). This piece is a quartet for clarinet, violin, cello and piano inspired in part by Oliver Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps, and performed by the [Octandre Ensemble](https://www.octandre.com/).**"**

## Buffy Sainte-Marie – Now That the Buffalo's Gone
_Sanjay_: **"**Subtle and stray harp plucks like gentle accretions of sounds that bounce into each other and evaporate give this piece, by [Mary Lattimore](http://marylattimoreharpist.tumblr.com/), a feeling of being secluded deep in the forest. A beautifully meditative piece for this Sunday morning.**"**

## Trio Da Kali – Yirimadjo
_Sanjay_: **"**Extending such environmental themes to our planet's rapidly deteriorating climate and biodiversity, this is a shadowy and ominous piece from Rebecca Foon's [Saltland](http://www.saltland.ca/) project. Music suitably filled with a complex and dense soundscape making sweet misery out of melody.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Christine Ott](http://www.christineott.fr/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
