<p id="introduction">This morning, </p>

# Paragraph 2


# Edyth's morning inspiration

## Foreign/National - Paris
_Sekuoai:_ **"**I've been listening to this band the last month, and I really like this ep. Both the sound and melody in this track gets me everytime.**"**

## Airhead- Autumn
_Sekuoai:_ **"**This track is perfekt for waking up. The guitar sounds really good, and I love how the production sounds so accoustic. It's like a lullaby for either falling a sleep or waking up. I guess it's just really dreamy, which is why I like it.**"**

## Four tet - locked
_Sekuoai:_ **"**This track opens up in the best way ever. The drums alone sound really low fi, and when the melodic elements kick in it becomes really pshycedelic and is this weird mixture between club music and pshych rock. Four tet has a lovely approach to music, and his music is beautiful to wake up to on a sunday morning.**"**
