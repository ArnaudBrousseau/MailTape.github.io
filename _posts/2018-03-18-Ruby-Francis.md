Honey Dew - Lion Babe 

I love the colours and textures in this track, it's so spacey and relaxing

Head Over Heels - Troy Hudson - https://soundcloud.com/iamtroyhudson/head-over-heels

I discovered this song when Troy put it out 3 years ago and I'm still obsessed, those harmonies/ backing vocals have me melting

Still In Love - Solo Smith https://soundcloud.com/solomon-smith-834932779/still-in-love
