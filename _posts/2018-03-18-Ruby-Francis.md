<p id="introduction">This morning in our new episode, we enter into the world of movies. And to guide us in our journey, I'm delighted to have [Calypso Valois](https://www.facebook.com/calypsovalois/ "Calypso Valois's Facebook page") as our guest. Calypso Valois seems to be one of those timeless artists. Elli And Jacno's daughter, Etienne Daho's goddaughter, she naturally follows the lead of her elders, and continues their mission to magnify the French language.</p>


# Ruby Francis's selection


## Chopin — Etude po. 25 n. 11 ‘Le Vent d’Hiver’
_Ruby Francis_: **"**It is one of my favorite song, it makes me feel like I’m in a vicious but fantastic whirlwind. It is really interesting how the main melody is played with the left hand, whereas the right hand develops a « swirling » chromaticism.**"**

## Karl Heinz Schäfer — Exterieur, Exterieur Nuit (ost)
_Ruby Francis_: **"**I love soundtracks from 60s/70s/80s movies. After classical music, this is what I listen to the most. Listening to it on Sundays brings me into a particular state. It is such a pleasant feeling to watch a movie with your ears.**"**

## The Bee Gees — You Should Be Dancing
_Ruby Francis_: **"**That song always gives me so much energy. It even encourages me when it comes to household tasks.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Ruby Francis — Fall Asleep
_Louise_: **"**The energy, the rage spread by the rhythm of this track is welcomed to start a Sunday morning with a conquering spirit. For me, it already sounds like a classic. I distinguish a touch of Gainsbourg in the instrumental part, and elegance in the style of Francoise Hardy in the voice.**"**

## Khruangbin — Cómo Me Quieres
_Louise_: **"**This intrumental piece of art composed by this Texan genius could completely be the soundtrack from a movie of the last century.
The haunting melody of the electric guitar evoques me the beauty and the freedom of movies like _Easy Rider_, mixed with a bit of deepness and melancholia.**"**

## Petula Clark — La Nuit N'en Finit Plus
_Louise_: **"**Because lonely Sundays also need their anthem.**"**

## Soft Cell — Say Hello Wave Goodbye
_Louise_: **"**Sounding like an ending theme, this song is perfect to end our adventures.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all folks! Huge thank you to [Calypso Valois](https://www.facebook.com/calypsovalois/ "Calypso Valois's Facebook page") for her choices and thanks to [William](http://williamgirault.com/ "William's website") for the wonderful illustration. And thank you for listening to our Sunday tapes! If you liked this tape, share it with your friends.</p>

Honey Dew - Lion Babe 

I love the colours and textures in this track, it's so spacey and relaxing

Head Over Heels - Troy Hudson - https://soundcloud.com/iamtroyhudson/head-over-heels

I discovered this song when Troy put it out 3 years ago and I'm still obsessed, those harmonies/ backing vocals have me melting

Still In Love - Solo Smith https://soundcloud.com/solomon-smith-834932779/still-in-love
