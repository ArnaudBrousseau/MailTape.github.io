<p id="introduction">This morning, we’re taking you on a walk in the forest. Our guest [Nicola Cruz](https://www.facebook.com/nicolacruzz/) shared with us his visionary tracks where electronic sounds bring us to Nature. He collaborated with [Nicolas Jaar](http://mailta.pe/3/Nicolas-Jaar/) and has just released his debut album on the underground record label ZZK from Buenos Aires. Thought you knew “world music”? Well, think again.</p>

# Complicity, not competition.

As I was discovering Nicola's album ["Prender el Alma"](https://zzkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/prender-el-alma) beaufiful ideas about tolerance, mixity, compassion and love came to my mind. Filled with tropical drums, flutes and spiritual harmonies, this album turns to be a genuine _tour de force_ which opens a new chapter of electronic world music.

Clearly positive and inspired by the warm vibes of south America, he melts down the cold ice and manages to create a profund music which elevates the mind and warm up the soul. I can't wait to walk on the beach to the rhythm of Nicola's tracks, summer's gonna be great.
 
# Nicola Cruz's selection:

## Radiohead - Daydreaming

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**This song from the new album of Radiohead is the perfect transition for landing night dreams. It's one of those songs I listen to while still in bed, looking up at the ceiling with my eyes open.**"**


## Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith - Labyrinth II

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**Beautiful harmonies to start the day: a warm analogue sound inspires to be creative in music and in life. It all seems like it is going to be a sunny one.**"**

## Devendra Banhart - Santa Maria da Feira

_Nicola Cruz_: **"**A little bit of romance and songwriting skills from this one. Soothing Brazilian influenced rhythms and colours to get into the shower.**"**
