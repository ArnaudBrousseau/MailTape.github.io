<p id="introduction">Our pick of the week Nathan Jenkins, better known as [Bullion](https://bullion.bandcamp.com/), is a producer and songwriter from West London. And this sunday with "Never is the change", he is all set to lock you into an episode of experimental sounds, colourful melodies and lyric that calls for change.</p>

# Loop the Loop...

Here’s an episode carefully handpicked for you to start afresh on your weekend. To those of you who haven’t quite tuned into his avant garde music, we say give “Loop The Loop,” his debut album, a shot.    
 
# Bullion's selection:

## Larry Coryell - The Lion & The Ram
_Bullion_: "Rise & shine, glass in hand and start again. "Learning, knowing."

## Terry Reid - Dream
_Bullion_: "Opening lines are all important and Terry swoops in with true love and regret. Changes are sweet as they come. Keeps unravelling, but control prevails."

## Jan Hammer - Plants And Trees
_Bullion_: "Surrounded as you are, give in and listen."


<p id="outroduction">
That's all folks, thanks to [Bullion](https://bullion.bandcamp.com/) for his magical selection.</p>
