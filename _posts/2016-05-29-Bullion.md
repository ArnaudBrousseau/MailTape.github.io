# Headline

Words...
 
# Bullion's selection:

## Larry Coryell - The Lion & The Ram
_Bullion_: "Rise & shine, glass in hand and start again. "Learning, knowing."

## Terry Reid - Dream
_Bullion_: "Opening lines are all important and Terry swoops in with true love and regret. Changes are sweet as they come. Keeps unravelling, but control prevails."

## Jan Hammer - Plants And Trees
_Bullion_: "Surrounded as you are, give in and listen."
