# Headline

Words...
 
# Poom's selection:

## Air - Femme d’Argent
_Poom_: "A souvenir from adolescence, a song we used to listen to over and over, feeling small, but not so sad about it."

## Vulfpeck - Back Pocket

_Poom_: "Jack Stratton is the guy you want to be friends with : he looks like Steven Spielberg on a shooting day in the 80’s and his band Vulfpeck is one of the coolest thing there is."

## Joao Gilberto & Tom Jobim - Aguas de Março

_Poom_: "Tom Jobim is the sun, without him it would be cold and dark. Joao Gilberto is the sunglasses the sun passes through, so that you can enjoy it even more."
