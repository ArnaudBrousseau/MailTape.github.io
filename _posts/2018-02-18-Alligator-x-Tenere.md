<p id="introduction">This morning, our guest [Run Child Run](https://runchildrun.bandcamp.com/album/vanishing-point) has blessed us with a distinctive selection of timeless tracks.</p>


# Vanishing point

A point at which something disappears or ceases to exist. Have you ever felt it? Lived it? Experienced it? That point on the horizon where things are simply fading away, transforming into something mysterious and unknown. We all have seen it or maybe even just felt it, in an experience, the end of something, a metamorphosis. 

Run Child Run’s music will accompany you on this journey. His music rises from the soil, spreading out and beyond, lashing out sparks of star dust into the infinite matter. Run Child Run’s music is like a mystical silk veil engulfing you in a comforting yet blissful atmosphere. His tastes in music are just as delicate and touching, no drama, things are pure, joyful and filled with everlasting moments of emptiness perceived. 


# Run Child Run's selection

## Solange - Rise
_Run Child Run_: **"**Just a beautiful way to open an album, and a beautiful way to start a day.**"**

## Hugh - I Can't Figure You Out
_Run Child Run_: **"**I love the balance this song strikes, light on its feet yet full of yearning. And how much they translate with so few elements, its lovely.**"**

## JOYCE - Aldeia de Ogum 
_Run Child Run_: **"**One of my 1yr-old son's favorite songs, and has been since he was in the womb. Warms my heart everytime.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Run Child Run - Can't Catch Me
_ImaCrea_: **"**Elevate your mind, feel the blood in your veins and the fact that you are alive today. Escape the system, conquer your spirit, believe and act.**"**

## Sudan Archives - Come Meh Way
_ImaCrea_: **"**A beautiful gem curated by PS KY. Love how Stones Throw keep exploring so many diverse inspirations, confirming its position as one of the best record label at the moment.**"**

## Guillaume Teyssier - Les Princes Des Villes (Principles of Geometry remix)
_ImaCrea_: **"**Some may call it "cliché", I call it "an act of resistance". No more explanation, get off that screen stuck in your prefrontal cortex and let the sound flood your hypothalamus.**"**

## Sign Libra - Intro / Tropical plantarum 
_ImaCrea_: **"**Reconnect with earth mother, see with your eyes, stand on your feet, dance.**"**
