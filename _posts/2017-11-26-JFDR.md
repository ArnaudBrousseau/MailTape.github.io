<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome the latest solo project of Jófríður Ákadóttir, [JFDR](http://jfdrcurrent.com/), as she chooses three dreamy tunes for Sunday morning in collaboration with MailTape.</p>
<p>Her debut solo album, Brazil, is full of minimalist soundscapes with soft tumbling guitars and haunting electronics. However mesmerizing the music might be, however, Jófríður Ákadóttir’s own voice has a strength that’s made to seem fragile with its vibrato—like a solid pane of glass vibrating just enough not to shatter.</p>


# JFDR's selection



## Indridi – Dreamcat
_JFDR_: **"**I would wake up from a dreamcat, the sort of dreamcat you find creeping in your subconsciousness on Sunday mornings. I would speak Icelandic to my foreign lover. I would make coffee with chinese five-spice and with every sip think about veggie pho. I would blast this song, confusedly, to the world thinking why can't you see what I see.**"**

## Sam Evian – Cactus
_JFDR_: **"**On my Sunday morning I would feel too warm, no matter the season, in a winter storm with the heating so blazingly high I open the window to acquire the perfect temperature. In my warmth I feel sad, I breathe deep for the wounded, out streams contentment. Tonglen.**"**

## Bruce Springsteen – I'm On Fire
_JFDR_: **"**I've done this many times, many mornings, not just Sunday mornings—although lately Sundays have felt more like a concept man-made, representing something more spiritual than organisational, and is more fluid in my life than it is to most people. I would be sitting one afternoon, midweek or whatever it is, and be certain it was more Sunday than any other day of the week, the year or over the course of my existence. I've done this many times—I've not been able to get out of bed due to the world's constantly shifting freshness, sometimes darkness, but mostly just groundlessness, and this song has had a particular influence: it has a drive mixed with simplicity that I've been so moved by I've forgotten about the complications of my existence and carried on. Thank you Bruce Springsteen.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## JFDR — Instant Patience
_Sanjay_: **"**It's hard for me to pick just one track from Yazz's latest album, 'La Saboteuse'. This piece begins with Shabaka Hutchings's solo bass clarinet which evokes a beautiful sadness, like a craggy autumnal landscape. Yazz’s trumpet melody is magisterial, composed of Arabic scales, which are counterpointed with a quiet and foreboding percussion.**"**

## Bianca Rose ft. Ayanna Witter Johnson – Because of Love
_Sanjay_: **"**Stark and eerie...like a hollow tree, this track consists of cello and violin beautifully played by [Fran and Flora](https://www.franandflora.com/), respectively. They fuse traditional motifs of Eastern European music with their own experimental compositions and improvisation. I'm looking forward to their upcoming debut album. Such a cool duo!**"**

## Gaelynn Lea — Watch the World Unfold
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from pianist [Zoe Rahman](http://www.zoerahman.com/). I've seen her perform a couple of times in London and Leicester and I love the rhythmic ruminations with repeating low themes emerging in the gaps between treble trills in this track. If you're in London, Zoe will be performing [solo at lunchtime on 13th November](https://www.pizzaexpresslive.com/whats-on/zoe-rahman) as part of this year's jazz festival.**"**

## Meshell Ndegeocello – Oysters
_Sanjay_: **"**In this title track from the [Vijay Iyer Trio](http://vijay-iyer.com/), the unbridled energy of Vijay Iyer’s piano is grounded by Marcus Gilmore’s drums and Stephan Crump’s bass. They create a mesmeric tension, as the track builds towards and dissolves into a contrastingly meditative break in which earlier motifs are deconstructed. Here, also, the drums quietly emerge for the first time before ceding the melody to the piano, which gradually regains its earlier intensity. If you haven't done so already, I'd recommend hearing Vijay—alongside his many ensembles—live!**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks so much for listening and much gratitude to Jófríður Ákadóttir ([JFDR](http://jfdrcurrent.com/)) for being our guest, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's beautiful illustration!</p>
