# **Max Future’s selection**

+ ## M.E.D. - Cant Hold On
_Max_: **"**I love this track, the rythym is so loud and the piano's sample so soft. When the bassline is coming, it's totally impossible to not shaking your head to the roof from the ground! **"**

+ ## Tame impala - Prototype (Outkast cover) 
_Max_: **"**For me it's a perfect exemple of a good cover. I usually prefer when the cover get away from the original but here, I found that Tame Impala grab this Outkast's track in a very sensitive way, but keep the original mood of it.**"**

+ ## Joakim - Nothing Gold
_Max_: **"**With "Nothing Gold" Joakim please all 70s or 80s funk's diggers. It's the kind of track wich I love listen in repeat, dissecting every synth sounds and all those small intents for analog producing lovers.  **"**
