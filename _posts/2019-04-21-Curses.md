<p id="introduction"> This morning, [Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) is welcoming us aboard his creative ship, you'd better be ready to weigh the anchor, sailor boys! From the Horn of Africa to foggy pirate havens, from the peaceful lands of England to the abyssal depths of the oceans, let yourself be guided by our guest, through awesome storms and mysterious sea creatures, all down to faraway places. Set sail!
<br><br>

[Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) is the project of London-based multi-instrumentalist and producer William Dorey. Initially, Dorey wanted to use samples, as a way to bring his 1960s-0s Funk, Soul, Reggae and Afrobeat influences forward, to create instrumental Hip-Hop and Trip-Hop tracks. As he bought a tape-machine with his student loan and started to record his own drum break samples, his sound turned out to be a kind of stoned, psychedelic folk. With all elements being recorded by Dorey, [Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) sounds like the perfect partner for a solo Sunday morning expedition.

# Curses' selection



## Jamie Paton - Enhance 224
[Curses](https://soundcloud.com/cursesforever/): **"**Höga Nord is a label mastering the psychedelic and wave tip for me at the moment. This recent Jamie Paton is an absolute slow and swampy heater for the clubs, siren sucker no gimmick, all fire.**"**

## Russian Chandeliers - Stay In Seattle (Zombies In Miami Remix)
[Curses](https://soundcloud.com/cursesforever/): **"**This whole package is a very powerful release. Russian Chandeliers are rad, Zombies in Miami are trippy and cool, and this remix rings the life out of the darkest dark electro-acid shadows of the night.**"**

## Cabaret Voltaire - Here To Go (Little Dub)
[Curses](https://soundcloud.com/cursesforever/): **"**One of my biggest influences is Cabaret Voltaire.The 1987 album, Code is especially important to me -they were experimenting with drum machines an guitars in a way nobody else really was at the time. When I first heard this I was immediately drawn to the drums and vocal chops. I began searching for more music like it and discovered the whole Belgian New Beat sound which still to this day is a big inspiration in my sound.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Curses](https://soundcloud.com/cursesforever/) - Fortify
Luc: **"**A fairly new yet quintessential Curses track. You can find all the elements that define his sound, from the EBM and disco influences, to the snappy bassline. The B-movie samples sitting atop the whole thing, coupled with a tension building break revolving around his synth, create a dancefloor belter prone to make you move even after a tough Saturday night out.**"**

## [Perel](https://soundcloud.com/perel-music/) - Alles
Luc: **"**This song is taken from 'Colt', [Hilary Woods](https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/)'s debut album she spent 2017 writing and recording in an abandoned flat she was living in at the time.  Jazz drums, classical strings and sensuous synth work slowly wrap and surround the piano melody to design majestic spaces while the Irish singer's voice sounds like a siren's.**"**

## [Benedikt Frey](https://soundcloud.com/freybenedikt/) - Iaon
Luc: **"**A multifaceted artist active under multiple monikers and bands, capable of delving into slow paced ambient krautrock jams ([Voltage](keys21.bandcamp.com/releases]Keys–Voltage/)) or trippy and minimalistic synth-pop electronics ([Init](https://iinit.bandcamp.com/track/talking-about-talking-2/)) as well as all-out acid cuts like Clown Time. His presence on the Lumière Noire compilation with the track above is not a fluke, Benedikt Frey shouldn’t fly under anyone’s radar!!**"**

## Tuxedomoon – No Tears
Luc: **"**A classic Post-Punk tune, 1978… 40 years and not a single wrinkle. Tuxedomoon are among those lesser known giants with a priceless legacy. An absolute treat!**"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thank you so much for embarking with us on our every Sunday journey!
