# Title.

Text

# Monsoonsiren's inspiring selection :
 
## Nathan Johnson - Emelys Theme (Brick OST)
Monsoonsiren: **"**I love the Brick OST and someone has been kind enough to compile each of the pieces on Soundcloud. This is music to lay in bed to whilst you stare at the ceiling, mimicking the finesse Jef Costello possesses.**"**

## Colin Stetson - Among the sef
Monsoonsiren:**"**I can't quite articulate precisely how this piece makes me feel. To call it cathartic would be a cliche.**"**

## Kanye West - Monster (Teachers remix)
Monsoonsiren: **"**Such a unique take on one of my favorite Kanye tracks.**"**
