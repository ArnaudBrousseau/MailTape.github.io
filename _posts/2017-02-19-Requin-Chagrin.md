<p id="introduction">This morning, take the time to slowly wake up to [Requin Chagrin](https://www.facebook.com/chagrin.requin/ "Facebook")' selection. British artist Infinite Bisous uses dreamy synths fused with a lo-fi psychedelic sound to create bittersweet songs, perfect for a Sunday morning. Stay a little bit longer in bed, allow yourself to feel this wintry melancholy for a moment, inhale, exhale, and enjoy a blissful journey through delicate, warm and dreamy sounds. There is no need to get out of bed when it's so cold outside.</p>


# **Requin Chagrin’s selection**

+ ## MJ Guider - Lit Negative
_Yohann from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I recently discovered the label Kranky, whose experimental and airy editorial line I have found quite similar to Sacred Bones Records.
Released by them in 2016, this great album from MJ Guider possesses an interesting dichotomy, from mixing floaty oneirism, ghostly song and industrial coolness. A winning combination to drown you in your Sunday torpor.**"**

+ ## Kommode - Patient
_Romain from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I hardly ever listen to music on Soundcloud, but I stumbled back across this (put into my favourites five years ago...). "Kommode" is the solo project of Eirik Glambek Bøe, a member of Kings Of Convenience (which I am a long-time fan of) but who unfortunately never released more than two songs.
When Kings Of Convenience decided to separate in order to concentrate on their solo projects, member Erlend formed The Whitest Boy Alive and I found it superb. I was expecting the same on the part of Eirik, but that has sadly not been the case.
Generally speaking, I like the refreshing difference of these small Norwegian geniuses, one of the reasons for which I would like to take a holiday there one day, lost among the mountains and lakes.**"**

+ ## Barbagallo - Nouveau Sidobre
_Marion from Requin Chagrin_: **"**I had the chance to see them play at Point Éphémère in Paris and it was great. Since then I've had this song in my head, as was the case last Sunday, so it's perfect!**"**
