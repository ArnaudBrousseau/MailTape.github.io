<p id="introduction">This morning, whether you’re on holidays enjoying the sun or trekking on a mountain or still recovering from a hangover or on a regular Sunday at home, we got you covered. This kaleidoscopic selection inspired by She-Devils, our punk friends from Argentina will shake you up, surprise you and make you dance. As they say, “put your trust on me, I won’t let you fall”.
</p>

# Vibrations

The essence of nature come from the sun, being its first source of energy. Mummy told me not to watch the sun but we all need that warmth to explode in joy and happiness so we invented something else. 

Something that nurrish our inspiration, fill us with joy and connect us in the most pure and deep sense, we called it music. 

Love you folks, thanks for being with us, this the 270th episode ! We’re doing it for something bigger than us, we do it for the love of music.a
