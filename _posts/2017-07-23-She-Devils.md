# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Llorca – Lights Behind Windows
_Laura_: **"** I rarely do this but here is one of my all time favourite song so no kidding here ! Lights Behind Windows comes from Llorca’s debut album [Newcomer](https://soundcloud.com/llorcaofficial/sets/newcomer-2), one of the few cult electro-jazz albums. The song is a pure dream, with an amazingly well composed contrast between the fast beat and a softer jazzy touch given by the light piano notes and saxophone solos. The light lullaby on the back gives me delightful chills and got me hooked. I hope you will enjoy this song as much as I did over the past 16 years. **"** 

+ ## Seb Wildblood – Jazz Vol. 1
_Laura_: **"** I just discovered Seb Wildblood this week and I immediately connected his sound to Llorca’s. Nostalgic, hypnotic, it perfectly moves through classic jazz and house music. Seb Wildblood is a young DJ and producer from South London on the rise. **"**

+ ## Quantic & His Combo Babaro – Undelivered Letter
_Laura_: **"** To continue in the same travelling vein, let me introduce Quantic aka Will Holland, a British DJ and producer signed on the prestigious Tru Thoughts label who loves to blend latin music with Soul and Electronic sounds. This song comes from his first album as Quantic & His Combo Babaro which highlights in a brilliant way his Columbian influences. **"**

+ ## Urbs & Cutex – Up & Down
_Laura_: **"** Urbs & Cutex is quite a mystery. Formed by the DJs David Schuller and Paul Nawrata, the duo only released two albums in 2004 before completely vanishing. But this track remains iconic in the downtempo-hip-hop spheres. Up & Down makes me feel light hearted and inspired every single time I listen to it. **"**
