<p id="introduction">This morning, it's been a while since we last spoke, but I knew the universe would always bring us back together. I'm still up for being your sonic companion if you are too, and I'm aching for adventure. Labelle, a sonic dreamer from the Islands of La Réunion, will join us, if that's alright?</p>

Labelle has been on his own sublime voyage, of which we can only hear the whispers that have crept across the night sky. These tendrils are reaching out to us from somewhere several worlds away, resonating with the echo of a pendulum swinging to a different measure of time. But even in spaces we cannot see and places we cannot imagine, the constellations that we look out onto are the same, ready to guide us across uncertain geographies.

The invitation remains open for you to join us, even just as far as [Labelle](https://www.facebook.com/labelle.music)'s debut album, [Univers-île](https://infine-rec.bandcamp.com/album/univers-le), released by our friends at Infiné Records.

If you are in Paris and free on **May the 24th** go see him live, he's having [a release party at Hasard Ludique](https://www.facebook.com/events/2012930832282013/).

# Labelle's selection

## Cara Tivey Trio – Contemplation
_Jitwam_: **"**Wake up slow...let the world come to you. [Cara Tivey](https://soundcloud.com/cara-t) on keysss and blissful harmonies.**"**

## Jay Electronica – Dear Moleskine
_Jitwam_: **"**[Jay Electronica](https://soundcloud.com/jayelectronica) is light. No matter how fast he raps, his words enter my consciousness so slowwww. An inspiration for the inspired.**"**

## Sam Reed – Love Ain't Free
_Jitwam_: **"**If you wants to feels good you got to listen to music that makes you feel good. This tune always puts a spring in my step and some melancholy in my whistle.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## jitwam. – alone
_Sanjay_: **"**There's a simmering storm beneath the acoustic strums of this track, coerced by generous helpings of reverb and musings on isolation.**"**

## Henry Wu – Shahada
_Sanjay_: **"**[Henry Wu](http://www.smarturl.it/kw-thereturn) and [Kieron Ifill](http://blog.nutriot.com/tag/kieron-ifill) combine to provide a two-step bedrock for delicate strings to glide over, sitting alongside an infectious and restless b-line with just enough groove for a Sunday morning.**"**

## Nabihah Iqbal – Eden Piece
_Sanjay_: **"**Lull yourself into a hazy dream this morning with [Nabihah Iqbal](https://nabihahiqbal.bandcamp.com/)'s pared-back track, Eden Piece. All wandering and lilting piano lines, booming kicks and breathy vocals.**"**

## Yves Tumor – The Feeling When You Walk Away
_Sanjay_: **"**From a cavernous looping riff reveals [Yves Tumor](https://soundcloud.com/yvestumor/)’s voice, an anguished falsetto steeped in phantasmal echoes that sounds as if it’s simultaneously vanishing just as it’s appearing.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Jitwam.](https://www.facebook.com/jitwam/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
