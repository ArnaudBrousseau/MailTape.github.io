<br><br>
With.</p>


# Bachar's selection

## King Princess – Holy
_Zoya_: **"**Love this tune and the production. [King Princess](https://kingprincessmusic.com/) always gets me in a good romantic mood. Love starting the day with romance in my brain.**"**

## [Noah Kahan](http://noahkahan.com/) – Young Blood
_Zoya_: **"**This is one of my favorite driving songs. I've been bumping it lately first thing in the morning when I go on my coffee run. Try your Sunday morning with this one. Super nostalgic vibe.**"**

## [Marc E. Bassy](http://www.marcebassy.com/) – Morning
_Zoya_: **"**Ah, I love this tune right now. I really want to make baby-making music like this one day! (haha*) Love the keys, synths and organs. This one put's me in a such a happy mood. Vibeyyyyy. Straight vibes.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Zoya – Keep You Mine
_Sanjay_: **"**Released just last Friday, this latest track from Zoya plays a tasteful balancing act—blending elements of American dance music and catchy lyrics with vocal melodies rooted by Indian pop music.**"**

## Rvdical The Kid – Hawaii (with amaarae & EDWVN)
_Sanjay_: **"**At just under two minutes long this track from [Rvdical the Kid](https://soundcloud.com/rvdicalthekid/) featuring [amaarae](http://amaaraemusic.com/), with additional vocals by [EDWVN](https://soundcloud.com/edwvn), carries a dreamy and whispery vibe. The beat and her singing rise contemporaneously, her voice sliding along the rising soundscape of the song.**"**

## mobilegirl – Forest Coloss
_Sanjay_: **"**Beautiful and subdued, yet sharp as a tack. Taken from Berlin-based [mobilegirl](https://soundcloud.com/mobilegirl)'s (a.k.a. Bao-Tran Tran) first official release, 'Poise'. An EP of lilting strings, elegant arrangements and placid drums.**"**

## Oumou Sangaré – Djoukourou (Auntie Flo Remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**Beginning and ending with fluttering xylophone sounds swaying back and forth between two tones, [Auntie Flo](https://soundcloud.com/auntie-flo/)'s remix transforms [Oumou Sangaré](https://www.instagram.com/oumou.sang/)’s original—adorned with Wassoulou instruments—into a percussion-rich, dancefloor-centric reimagination.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Zoya](http://www.zoyamusicofficial.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
