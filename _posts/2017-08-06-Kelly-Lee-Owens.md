<p id="introduction">This morning </p>

# Kelly Lee Owens's selection

## Alice Coltrane - Journey In Satchidananda
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**The bass!!! My god! And the harp of course... just wow! A track every one should have heard. I usually listen to this on repeat in the dark.**"**

## Cocteau Twins - Wax & Wane 
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**It's SO hard to choose one track from Cocteau Twins as it's safe to say they are one of my favouite bands. Liz's voice! Distorted bass lines ! Drum Machine ! So much atmosphere !
I love how the vocals are used abstractly at times - the "lyrics" are shaped by what sounds Liz feels she needs to make in reaction to the music - it's so pure.**"**

## Aphex Twin - Acrid Avid Jam Shred 
_Kelly Lee Owens_: **"**I love pretty much every track he's ever made - his production is insane! His tracks could have been made a week ago - he's always been so ahead of everyone else in the game. I'm looking forward to seeing him at Primevera this year!**"**
