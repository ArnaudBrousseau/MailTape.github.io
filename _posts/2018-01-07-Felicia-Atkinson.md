<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome preeminent Rennes-based avant-garde composer [Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/) to collaborate with us on MailTape. She weaves myriad, filigree electro-acoustic and non-musical metanarratives into a sonic lucid dream.</p>
<p>Félicia Atkinson is a multidisciplinary artist with many more strings to her bow. On her latest album 'Hand in Hand', however, the atmosphere of reflective anticipation is the main sonic theme—where a sense of otherworldly is paired with the familiar and the macabre with the sensual.</p>


# Félicia Atkinson's selection


## Tomoko Sauvage – Musique Hydromantique
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Wake up early enough to see the sun rise and breathe its energy.**"**

## Luc Ferrari – Presque rien n°1, le lever du jour au bord de la mer
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Let the silence become music and contemplate the light changing.**"**

## Cinema – Sem Toto
_Félicia Atkinson_: **"**Jump and raise your arms to the sun. It’s gonna be a good day enough.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Félicia Atkinson – I'm Following You
_Sanjay_: **"**[Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/)'s latest album 'Hand in Hand' fuses field recordings, modular and MIDI electronics with an almost hypnotising line in whispered vocal narration to subliminally affective degrees. In this opening track, dreams and reality go fluidly and fittingly together with a warbling ambient-pop/neo-classical introduction to the reflective anticipation of the album.**"**

## Mondkopf – The Call
_Sanjay_: **"**The moniker of Paul Régimbeau, [Mondkopf](http://mondkopf.tumblr.com/)'s electronic music often feels extremely literal. This track is taken from the [Musique Ambiante Française Vol. 1](https://tigersushirecords.bandcamp.com/album/musique-ambiante-fran-aise-vol-1) compilation on Tigersushi. It's a serenely seductive suite of ambient or beatless works using old and new analog machines.**"**

## Christine Ott – Tropismes
_Sanjay_: **"**'Ahwar' is a brilliant debut LP from Cairo-based musician [Nadah El Shazly](https://nadahelshazly.bandcamp.com/). Joining her are guitarist Sam Shalabi and Maurice Louca (both members of The Dwarfs Of East Agouza with Alan Bishop). On this mostly acoustic track, Nadah sings broodingly over chugging acoustic guitar chords as flutes, violins and muted percussion create a stark, unhurried and morose atmosphere.**"**

## Murcof & Vanessa Wagner – Variations For The Healing Of Arinushka
_Sanjay_: **"**This is the second album from [Jerusalem In My Heart](https://www.jerusaleminmyheart.com/), a collaborative project helmed by Radwan Ghazi Moumneh and fellow Montréal-based artist, Charles-André Coderre. Here, the slow application of delicate processing, Radwan's voice and the ringing percussion somehow feel desperately sad but never completely hopeless.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Félicia Atkinson](http://feliciaatkinson.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's sweet illustration!</p>
