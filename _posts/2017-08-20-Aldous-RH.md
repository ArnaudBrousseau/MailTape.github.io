<p id="introduction">This morning, [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook")</p>
<p></p>


# **Aldous RH's selection**

+ ## Silk Rhodes - Stuck in my Head
_Aldous RH_: **"**Mike & Sasha are good friends, and wonderful tunesmiths, particularly the work they do in Silk Rhodes is the perfect mixture of the sultry, smooth & the eclectic. Minimal soul at its finest and an adequate sensual Sunday accompaniment.**"**

+ ## Jerry Paper - Gracie II
_Aldous RH_: **"**Lucas has a real ear for the understated, his melodies are so strong yet so oblique. This tune however is probably his sweetest most direct ballad thus far. [Badbadnotgood](https://www.mailta.pe/110/bbng/ "MailTape 110") providing rhythm section too can never be bad when you're in the need for some subtle grooves.**"**

+ ## Bwengo Nuabey - Secondarny
_Aldous RH_: **"**This guy is second to none when it comes to quality over quantity. This one'll get you feeling all worldly + eastern intrigued. Essential sunday listening.**"**


# Mailtape's selection

+ ## Aldous RH - Sensuality
_Inès_: **"**.**"** 

+ ## Joey Fourr - Bath Thiem
_Inès_: **"**Smooth, blissful, luxurious synth-pop with a dash of groove. The musical equivalent of satin bedsheets.**"**

+ ## Exit Someone - Absent Lover
_Inès_: **"**.**"**

+ ## Drugdealer - Suddenly (ft. Weyes Blood)
_Inès_: **"**Let’s end this episode on an joyful note. Seen live in Paris a few months ago, Drugdealer was a revelation. This song in particular, featuring Weyes Blood, is one my favorites from their album "The End of Comedy". With its highs and lows, it feels like a musical, and makes us travel to California. You can almost feel the sun on your neck.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [Aldous RH](https://www.facebook.com/AldousRH/ "Facebook") for his participation, Daisy for the introduction and [Camille Célestin](https://www.facebook.com/bravocamo "Facebook") for the illustration. Have a groovy Sunday!</p>
