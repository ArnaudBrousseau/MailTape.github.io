# **Aldous RH's selection**

+ ## Silk Rhodes - Stuck in my Head
_Aldous RH_: **"**Mike & sasha are good friends, and wonderful tunesmiths, particularly the work they do in Silk Rhodes is the perfect mixture of the sultry, smooth & the eclectic. Minimal soul at its finest and an adequate sensual Sunday accompaniment.**"**

+ ## Jerry Paper - Gracie II
_Aldous RH_: **"**Lucas has a real ear for the understated, his melodies are so strong yet so oblique. This tune however is probably his sweetest most direct ballad thus far. Badbadnotgood providing rhythm section too can never be bad when you're in the need for some subtle grooves.**"**

+ ## Bwengo Nuabey - Secondarny
_Aldous RH_: **"**This guy is second to none when it comes to quality over quantity. This one'll get you feeling all worldly + eastern intrigued. Essential sunday listening.**"**
