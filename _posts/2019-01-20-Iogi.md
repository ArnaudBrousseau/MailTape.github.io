<p id="introduction">This morning 
  
<br><br>


</p>


# Iogi's selection

## Jonti - Batmilk
_Iogi_: **"**This song used to be my alarm clock. It has the most beautiful melodic lines and the perfect vibe for every hour, but especially for the moment you open your eyes in the morning. I know what they say about putting a song you love as your alarm clock and then not wanting to hear it ever again - well, that is just not the case.  **"**

## Super Furry Animals - The Gift That Keeps On Giving
_Iogi_: **"**I just LOVE this band. There is a simplicity and delicate beauty to their amazing pop songs, especially in this album - "Hey Venus!". It was pretty hard to choose a favourite song out of it. Time goes by and i still adore it.**"**

## Tigris - Tigris
_Iogi_: **"**A group of amazing musicians from Tel Aviv that make a beautiful mix of african and pop instrumental music. There is plenty of humor in their tunes, which i love, and their shows are fantastic!**"**
