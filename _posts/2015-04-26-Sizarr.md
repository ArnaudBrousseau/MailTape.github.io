Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland - 2

This is a beautiful song. it is a cover from the original donnie & joe emerson - baby on their album dreamin’ wild. The story behind this album is pretty incredible and i think they are making a documentary about that too. if you don’t know about it you should look it up! Anyways there have been several cover versions of this song already also by ariel pink but i like this one the most.

Julian Lynch - Gloves

A song from Julian Lynch's 'Lines' album. I really like the live sound of the whole album, all those guitars and clarinets. But on this song it's the bassline that got me.

Giant Claw - Dark Web 005

Dark Web was my favourite album of last year. I love it so much that I actually have 2 copies of it. This song might be my favourite one, but that's changing all the time. Do yourself a favour and listen to the entire album, it's a real treat!
