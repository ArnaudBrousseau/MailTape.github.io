<p id="introduction">This groove-laden playlist is rich in bass and has a somewhat retro touch to it. Curated in collaboration with [Blutch](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blutch/333167113396807): a french artist—it adequately sets the mood as it lets music be the guide to your entire weekend journey while ensuring that you get your much needed respite.</p>

# Our latest fling

[Blutch](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blutch/333167113396807), our pick of the week, has the ability to make moments come alive. “Don’t you mind" & "Woman 2 Woman,” are the two tracks that we encourage you to dig and relax to.  The selection is also an instant release from everything that gets in the way of you and your early morning coffee.  The artists are promising and their music is meant to catch your ear. Go ahead and give it a go!


# H-Burns' morning inspiration
 
## Troy Von Balthazar - Dots and Hearts
_H-Burns:_ **"**Troy sang on Night Moves and the young woman who sings with him on this song is a great friend of mine - we come from the same city. It's a beautiful gem of eternal pop, a lovely pair.**"**
 
## Syd Matters - Obstacles
_H-Burns:_ **"**My blood brothers, my mystical faction. A piece that I could qualify as "classic" as it makes time pass and it ages so well. Incredibely etheral.**"**
 
## Bertrand Belin - Hypernuit
_H-Burns:_ **"**"Celui-là même qui
Se souvient d'un jour derrière
Bien enfui
Bien qu'enfui
Il n'a rien oublié
Du jour entre tous cruel
Au bout duquel
Il a vu sa maison brûler" _(quote from the song)_
Everything is said. How beautiful!**"**
