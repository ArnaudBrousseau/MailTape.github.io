<p id="introduction">This Sunday, let yourself dive into a universe of musical indulgence powered by softness. Pleasure to welcome [Superpoze](https://www.facebook.com/SuperpozeMusic) and his selection of blissful tunes. Waking peacefully to the sound of indulgence followed by an explosion of temptation filled with surprises.</p>


# Reveries and Fantasies

Whether you like it dreamy, fancy, funky or simply groovy, relax in the passenger seat of the Superpoze carousel and let the musical electrolytes revive your senses. 

You’ll wake up on a Shigeto cloud, letting your eyelids unfold with the gentleness of each lyrical breath. Lucky us!! Saturn boy is here to make you feel the jitters of universal melancholy, pinching your utmost desires for joy with sincerity. And it seems unicorns exist after all. The stars are aligned, ready to take us for a fleeting yet memorable voyage. A flow enchanted with beats, welcoming you to the Sunday of your dreams. 

The journey continues, overseas we go, with the electric and catchy tunes of Superpoze’s Sekuoia remix. Almost ready to rise, with pace and style, moving forward, Felix Laband is vibrant, a parallel of what it probably feels like to squeeze life out of vanity. 

We rise & fall with Garnier’s confidence; we all need a friend don’t we? It’s time to go I think, both feet on the floor, out of the bed we go, accompanied by the beats of JeF ZeRo’s zesty and reviving Arcade Funke.
