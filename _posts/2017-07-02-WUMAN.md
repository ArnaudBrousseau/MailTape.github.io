<p id="introduction">This morning, let's have a mellow Sunday morning thanks to [WUMAN](https://www.facebook.com/wumanband/ "Facebook")'s selection. Self-described as female music composed by male humans, WUMAN 

Manchester based Gorgeous Bully makes lo-fi, DIY bedroom grunge-pop tracks. Catchy, minimal and sincere, Gorgeous Bully's music is striking, and welcomed in current times.</p>




# **WUMAN's selection**

+ ## Mort Garson - Plantasia
_Nico from WUMAN_: **"**Because it makes me think of Sunday mornings in my grandmother's living room when I was a kid: Cobra, Albator and toasts with white chocolate.**"**

+ ## Black Flower - Upwards
_Marin from WUMAN_: **"**Because ethiobeat makes you want to cook and that on Sundays, you have the time to cook.**"**

+ ## GUTS - Come Closer
_Rey from WUMAN_: **"**It's the end of weekend track, when you partied on Saturday and that you are in an altered state the day after, so you do nothing serious all day, except a barbecue-Tarot by a lake with your friends, the end of afternoon sunlight shining on your neck, you are just right.**"**



# Mailtape's selection

+ ## WUMAN - Alice
_Inès_: **"**"Alice", taken from WUMAN's first EP [Portraits](https://wumanband.bandcamp.com/ "EP") A summery track **"** 

+ ## MariusAtherton — Partie De Campagne
_Inès_: **"**As stated in this song's description, it is "the wonderful story of a Sunday in the 19th century". A depiction of a picnic, a story about the little _bourgeoisie_, an ironic bliss.**"**

+ ## Forever Pavot - Le Passeur d'Armes
_Inès_: **"**Forever Pavot is an amazing French artist who released _Rhapsode_, his first album, a few years ago. "Le Passeur d'Armes" is my favorite song from it: a sexy, deconstructed, arrhythmic, epic track.**"**

+ ## Blisss - Fai Yen
_Inès_: **"**Sampled from a Thai song made by Ream Daranoi, "Fai Yen" is cool.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That’s all folks! Thanks to [WUMAN](https://www.facebook.com/wumanband/ "Facebook") for their participation, and [Anaïs Caura](http://cargocollective.com/anaiscaura "Website") for the illustration. Have the coolest of Sundays! </p>
