<p id="introduction">This morning, [Moodoïd](https://www.facebook.com/Moodoid/) wakes you up with their hot-and-cold selection. Moodoïd is the creation of Pablo Padovani, guitar player in Melody's Echo Chamber. Moodoïd is modern French psych pop: synths, funky rythm, sensuality, French storytelling lyrics with a strong curated persona. They released [Cité Champagne](http://smarturl.it/MoodoidCiteChampagne), their new album, a few months ago.

Shades of glittery pink, frosty white and velvety dark purple constitute the colour palette for this episode. Feels like languid dance moves and intense shared gazes from across a dancefloor. The theme is: less-is-more voluptuous music. Enjoy.</p>


# Tsembla's selection

## Tomoko Sauvage – Clepsydra
_Tsembla_: **"**Early morning or late night music. Rise at dawn, open a window.**"**

## Anne Guthrie – Branching Low And Spreading
_Tsembla_: **"**A conversation between loose acoustic instrumentation, beating tunings, processed field sounds and spaces. The track is from the album 'Codiaeum Variegatum', themed after a species of toxic plant. A truly brilliant album as a whole.**"**

## Raul Lovisoni & Francesco Messina – Prati Bagnati Del Monte Analogo
_Tsembla_: **"**This wonderful album from 1979 was reissued by Die Schachtel a few years ago and is one of the most played Sunday morning records in our household.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Tsembla – Gravitating Bones
_Sanjay_: **"**I love Moodoïd. This band exudes exquisite sexiness and makes you feel like you’re the hottest person alive, yet holds place for more sentimental, dreamy and vigorous songs, mixing all of that without ever being over the top. Flirting with tackiness but never crossing the line. Reptile is all of that: intense, dreamy, seductive, fabulous.**"**

## Wry Myrrh – Three
_Sanjay_: **"**A captivating and languid song sung with a high-pitched voice, a bit twisted, both delicate and strong.**"**

## Laurel Halo – Raw Silk Uncut Wood
_Sanjay_: **"**A little simple instrumental track. Very cute and nice. So pure. The musical equivalent of being worry-free.**"**

## Nadia Struiwigh – Roeiweijk
_Sanjay_: **"**Time to wake up. I’ve never been one for uber cheesy songs, but this one is an exception. Almost sounding like a child’s song, it is so innocent, yet so groovy and made for dancing (the bridge!). A super enthusiastic song for a super energetic morning!**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks so much for listening and lots of love to Pablo from [Moodoïd](https://www.facebook.com/Moodoid) for his selection, and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this beautiful illustration! Have a spicy Sunday.</p>
