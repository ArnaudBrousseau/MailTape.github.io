<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome vocalist and composer [Sara Serpa](https://www.saraserpa.com/) to pick three Sunday morning musical selections for us.
<br><br>
Sara has been crafting composed and improvised music for over 10 years, utilising her classically-trained voice on her compositions. Her approach touches on various musical threads, but it is not necessarily tethered to any—refracting, bending, suspending, and shifting sounds and syllables, creating a kind of linguistic limbo.</p>


# Utsav Lal's selection

## Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou – The Homeless Wanderer
_Utsav Lal_: **"**This is currently my favorite record to listen to when I wake up. I'm obsessed with musicians who develop very unique personal voices on their instruments particularly when it is a direct result of their background. She has such an incredibly personal way of approaching the piano which reflects her intense and vivid life story. As an Ethiopian nun who was an Italian prisoner of war and had to flee Ethiopia multiple times during her life to Jerusalem amongst many other places, her music really reflects a deep and unique culmination of all these facets. As pianist and composer, her use of decay, systems of organization is fascinating. It also just really makes me happy when I listen to the record. I chose the first piece and it's how I've started most of my mornings in the past few weeks and they're incredible gems. **"**

## Hilliard Ensemble – Viederunt Omnes (Pérotin)
_Utsav Lal_: **"**This is an incredible recording of an incredible piece. Its from the 12th/13th century which has its own feeling of awe associated with the legacy. The mystery behind the authentic and traditional way to interpret something that old is fascinating for me. I can't say too much about Gregorian chant music apart from reciting impersonal facts as its definitely not a tradition I purport to belong to but I will say that this piece has been an incredible catalyst for me to listen to the nuances of syllables and become way more consciously aware how this affects where in the frequency range everything we hear sits. It made me understand the sophistication of  Indian classical music in a deeper way. **"**

## Ustad Zia Fariduddin Dagar – Raga Jogia Durga
_Utsav Lal_: **"**There had to be a piece of Dhrupad from the Dagar family for several reasons. About 80 percent of the music I listen to is Dhrupad, I belong to the Dagar tradition, my guru is Wasifuddin Dagar. The Dagar dhrupad form of music is for me personally the most fascinating and rewarding in absolutely every conceivable way of listening to music. It's peaceful, violent, yearning, rhythmically/intonationally/lyrically/melodically fascinating. For me. The problem with selecting something is that its so hard to pinpoint recordings as this music kind of functions as this continuum for me. I feel like I don't put on recordings when I listen to them, I tune into something that is always going on. And also they're mostly an hour long which exceeds the maximum duration for this. I picked this recording of Jogia-Durga because Fariduddinji is the first person I heard singing Dhrupad at a concert in Delhi when I was 12 years old. There were a few different musicians performing that night and barely anyone was left when he took the stage. The difference between the absolutely pure intention and expression of his art to the people before him blew me away and sucked me straight into my obsession with Dhrupad. I heard this ten minute recording a few days ago heading home on a late train after attending a slightly disappointing show. It felt very special.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Utsav Lal – Raga Puriya
_Sanjay_: **"**This tune, a nod to their old haunt, is in an airy but enigmatic space for me. Sara’s atmospherics over André's spare phrasing and minimalist percussion brings that to life after a purposefully tentative start.**"**

## Jatinder Singh Durhailay — Tree
_Sanjay_: **"**From her [Dreams & Daggers](https://www.cecilemclorinsalvant.com/discography/) album, Cécile brings a puckish heat to Bessie Smith’s 'You’ve Got to Give Me Some': a blues aria of sexual innuendo with some great double meanings about butchers and milkmen.**"**

## Eve Risser – Yesterdays (Jerome Kern)
_Sanjay_: **"**Amira Kheir [picked a few Sunday morning tunes for us](https://www.mailta.pe/282/amira-kheir/) back in October 2017. She has since released a new album—[Mystic Dance](http://amirakheir.com/)—and this is its opening track. Its hypnotic, mellow and steady rhythm, alongside a modestly groovy bass, melodically evoking its name.**"**

## Myra Melford – Park Mechanics
_Sanjay_: **"**This thumri is a lilting raga in Pilu by the South Asian classical musician, [Meeta Pandit](http://www.meetapandit.com/), of the Gwalior Gharana. Meeta's voice stretches over an impressively wide range of over three octaves. She is also equally adept with genres of Tarana, Bhajan and Sufi, as well as cross-cultural music.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Sara Serpa](https://www.saraserpa.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
