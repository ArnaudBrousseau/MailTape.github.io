# Douglas Dare's morning inspiration
 
## iamamiwhoami - Thin
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**I'm a big fan of her voice and it's always the vocals that draw me to an artist. It's got a beautiful/ugly quality. This track also has two of my favourite things, a fade in and a tempo change. Been on repeat!**"**
 
## Andy Stott - Violence
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**Love the dynamic of this track and how unexpected it is. And it's so dark! It's been the perfect soundtrack to driving through US cities at night.**"**
 
## Buke and Gase - Seam Esteem
_Douglas Dare:_ **"**I can't help but slowly head bang to this track; it puts me in a trance. It's one of their more understated tracks, which I like because it's subtly groves and makes you want more.**"**
