<p id="introduction"> This morning, [Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) is welcoming us aboard his creative ship, you'd better be ready to weigh the anchor, sailor boys! From the Horn of Africa to foggy pirate havens, from the peaceful lands of England to the abyssal depths of the oceans, let yourself be guided by our guest, through awesome storms and mysterious sea creatures, all down to faraway places. Set sail!
<br><br>

[Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) is the project of London-based multi-instrumentalist and producer William Dorey. Initially, Dorey wanted to bring forward his love for old music by using samples from his 1960s-0s Funk, Soul, Reggae or Afrobeat influences to create instrumental Hip-Hop and Trip-Hop tracks. As he bought a tape-machine with his student loan and started to play around to record his own drum break samples, his sound turned out to be a kind of stoned, psychedelic folk. With all elements being recorded by Dorey since his debut album, Skinshape sounds like the perfect partner for a solo sunday morning expedition.

# Skinshape's selection



## Aamina Camaari - Rag waa Nacab Iyo Nasteexo (Men are Cruel and Kind)
Skinshape: **"**This song and sound is like nothing I’ve ever heard. It has a deep synth-led hypnotic groove, overlaid with the sweet psychedelic vocals of Aamina. Who would have thought this came from 1980s Somalia? I could listen to this groove all day.**"**

## The Lark Ascending - Ralph Vaughan Williams (LPO violin by Sarah Chang)
Skinshape: **"**I think I first heard this in the car one day. My mind followed that violin into many other dimensions in the minutes that followed. There is something so quintessentially English about this piece, it’s like the sound of my land, my green hills and my childhood. An emotional listen.**"**

## The Verve - Bittersweet Symphony
Skinshape: **"**This has always been a favourite of mine. The lyrics are amazing and the 90s production is also amazing. It’s a shame that The Verve never were allowed to make any money from it after the Rolling Stones court case.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## [Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) - Life As One
Jules: **"**he released his third album "Filoxiny" last November.**"**

## [Hilary Woods](https://hilarywoodsmusic.bandcamp.com/) - Prodigal Dog
Jules: **"****"**

## [Para One](https://soundcloud.com/para-one/) - Finale (Music To And From Naissance Des Pieuvres)
Jules: **"****"**

## Corte Real - Opium
Jules: **"****"**



<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thank you so much for being with us every Sunday, keep sharing the good vibes! Much love and respect to [Skinshape](https://skinshape.bandcamp.com/) for his Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](https://camillecelestin.com/) for her stunning illustration. </p>
