<p id="introduction">This morning, discover [Pavane](https://www.facebook.com/pavane.music), a young and talented musician whose inspiration is fed by nature. Filled with 6 blissful tracks spiced up with a rough one, this selection will put you in the best conditions to fly over the vast land of your imagination. Forget the seatbelt and simply let the music projects its scenery onto the screen of your closed eyelids.</p>

# Pavane, the free bird.

Moved by a great ambition without forgeting to stay humble, Pavane released a stunning debut album called '[L'échapée](https://eumolpe.bandcamp.com/album/l-chapp-e)'. Coming from the classical music scene, he started to experiment with electronic more recently. His music is the result of a deep maturity where violon strings and piano chords are delightfully melted with electronic waves. Think about it as Nils Frahm meets Rone. 

Clearly inspired by nature, Pavane takes us in his universe where a flock of flamingos fly in the sky with the grace of a ballet. Their reflect on the lake below mixed with the subtle light of the sunrise triggers a truly blissful moment.

# Pavane’s morning inspiration
 
## Avi Buffalo - Truth Sets In
_Cliché:_ **"**For us,"Truth Sets In" is one of the most beautiful pop song of 2010, as simple and beautiful as Sunshine.**"**
 
## Cylob - Rewind!
_Pavane:_ **"**We love for a while Rephlex label's productions, and particulary from Cylob. It's kind of crazy, it mix pop and electronic, we love the destruct process on voices.**"**
 
## Daniel Johnston - Speeding Motorcycle
_Pavane:_ **"**We discover Daniel Johnston through Yo La Tengo, a band we love a lot. His maladjustment to the standardized world, and his freedom are particulary touching. This track give us a survey to his messy and DIY universe.**"**
