<p id="introduction">This morning, discover [Cliché](https://www.facebook.com/cliche.pop?_rdr), the first signature of Microqlima, a new great frenchpop label . How immortalize and modernize the best of French Pop tradition ? Sing in french first, add the famous false innocent instru behind, a little bit electronic but don't forget acoustics instruments. And here we are ! The quintessence of 21th century French Pop ! </p>

# Cliché, the new frenchpop scene.

It's quit nice to listen Cliché's First EP. Their lovely five songs slide on your ears with a warm feeling. All look like simple. Childhood feeling grabs you and you can't do anything. Listen lyrics and dive in their romantic universe, where everything is metaphoric. As "Hélicon" which transform the weirdest brass instrument in the allegory of freedom.  

# From Bordeaux with love.
 
## Avi Buffalo - Truth Sets In
_Cliché:_ **"**For us,"Truth Sets In" is one of the most beautiful pop song of 2010, as simple and beautiful as Sunshine.**"**
 
## Cylob - Rewind!
_Pavane:_ **"**We love for a while Rephlex label's productions, and particulary from Cylob. It's kind of crazy, it mix pop and electronic, we love the destruct process on voices.**"**
 
## Daniel Johnston - Speeding Motorcycle
_Pavane:_ **"**We discover Daniel Johnston through Yo La Tengo, a band we love a lot. His maladjustment to the standardized world, and his freedom are particulary touching. This track give us a survey to his messy and DIY universe.**"**
