This morning, ladies and gentleman, please give a round of applause for our 18 yrs old composer, songwriter, guitarist, singer and violinist guest [Tom Misch](https://soundcloud.com/tom-misch "Tom Misch Soundcloud").

# Youth and good vibes

Tom Misch them. His EP [Ezra](http://grandbrothers.de/ "Tom Misch Bandcamp") and the tunes they [share](https://soundcloud.com/grandbrothers "Grandbrothers Soundcloud") on soundcloud convey many different feelings at a time: bewitched and ecstatic. This is the result of their musical experiment, trying to push further the limits of their grand piano. We're maybe not used enough to come across such approach and that's exactly the reason why we decided to introduce you to them.

#His morning selection

## Nick Hakim - Cold
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Discovered Nick Hackim's music whilst browsing YouTube videos of Berkley College Music graduates. Instantly fell in love with his extremely smooth soulful voice and style. jazzy chord progressions and great lyrics this track is right up my street.**"**

## Emily King - Georgia
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Everything about this track and almost all Emily King's stuff is stunning. The acoustic instrumentation, the rhythms.. the way the bass sits with the kick drum yet still has its own groove.. the chord changes in the chorus.. Emily's vocal harmonies.. the old fashioned sounding strings.. the way the music accompanies her lyrics.. i could go on forever!! pure bliss.**"**

## J-Dilla - Track 34
_Tom Misch:_ **"**Third track obviously had to get a dilla joint in here.. this one starts with the track he sampled, then it drops and his genius comes into play. laid back tempo and a dirty swing on the drums. For me, this beat has an undeniable positivity leaking from it and that's why it's good for pretty much any day of the week.**"**

Thatâ€™s all folks! A big thank to [Tom Misch](https://soundcloud.com/tom-misch "Tom Misch Soundcloud") for his selection. Thanks for listening, enjoy your sunday !
