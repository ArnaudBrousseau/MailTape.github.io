<p id="introduction">This morning, we meet with Polo & Pan! Yet another French duet that makes inspiring music to smooth our souls. When I discovered them, I instantly fell in love. A peaceful mood lives through their tracks and makes the world a better place each time I pump up the volume. Here is their fresh selection full of good vibes, just for you.</p>
 
# Polo & Pan's selection

## Francis Lai - Samba Saravah (A Man & A Woman OST)
_Polo & Pan_: **"**Beautiful cover of a Brasilian classic with the French Touch. When you wake up in Copacabana with freshly baked croissants.**"**

## Colette Magny - Melocoton
_Polo & Pan_: **"**For a morning full of emotions, between spleen and living live to the fullest.**"**

## Röyksopp - Daddy's Groove 
_Polo & Pan_: **"**A track that we could listen in the womb of our mother peacefully waiting to be born.**"**

# Mailtape's selection

## Polo & Pan - Bakara
_Louise_: **"**The thing I particularly love with Polo & Pan is their longest tracks. _Bakara_ is a great foretaste of their talent at making smooth tracks. It's a colorful song!**"**

## JHAS - Pain Au Chocolat
_Louise_: **"**Did you noticed this French vibe going on in Polo & Pan's selection? Well, I wanted to add a little more to the playlist. It's fun to hear the samples of Mireille Mathieu's voice saying absolutely meaningless syllables.**"**

## Elia y Elisabeth - Todo La Vida (Souleance Rework)
_Louise_: **"**We go on with a French duet that I LOVE. Souleance has the greatess tunes to dance and cheer everyone up. Here, they reworked Elia y Elisabeth's track « Todo En La Vida » from the LP _La Onda_. A perfect Sunday song.**"**

## Los Invasores - El Raton
_Louise_: **"**It's gets real with South America! We were in Colombia with Elia y Elisabeth and now Uruguay! This groovy melody will lighten your heart and soul. Wait for the chorus... and dance!**"**
