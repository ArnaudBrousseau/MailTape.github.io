<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome multilingual singer, songwriter and musician, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch). With songs in Swiss German, English, Jamaican Patois, Spanish and French, he represents a culture of co-existence without boundaries based on language, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>While his music has its origins in roots reggae, he has recently complemented it with dub, bossa nova, rap and blues elements. His latest remix album, [Dub Ripe Fruit](https://soundcloud.com/ariwasounds/sets/dub-ripe-fruits-elijah-rajing-fyah-joe-ariwa), is a collaboration with the Jamaican band [Raging Fyah](http://ragingfyah.com/) and [Joe Ariwa](http://ariwa.com/), the son of dub and reggae legend Mad Professor.</p>


# Saåad's selection


## Grails – The Burden of Hope
_Romain Barbot_: **"**This track has been my alarm clock for years. It’s still one of my favourite tracks and it gives me chills everytime I listen to it . If the melody is important, the drums parts are pure magic.**"**

## Kurt Vile – Best Love 
_Romain Barbot_: **"**I think it’s the perfect song to manage a Sunday hangover or a good excuse to stay in your bed.**"**

## King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard – Rattlesnake
_Romain Barbot_: **"**I played this album on repeat for months. Surely one of the best records of 2017. This track has the same effect as a quadruple espresso.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Saåad – The Harvest
_Sanjay_: **"**Not only impressive in its musical diversity, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch)'s album is more than just a series of Roots songs—it's a call to slow down, to exhale and let things run their course and mature into their natural destiny!**"**

## This Will Destroy You – The Puritan (Julianna Barwick remix)
_Sanjay_: **"**Aba-Shanti-I, former MC for Jah Tubby's Sound System, is part of the Aba-Shanti Sound System, one of London's leading roots and dub systems. This is wonderfully meditative with a  weighty bass throughout.**"**

## Pauline Oliveros – Suiren
_Sanjay_: **"**Based in Paris, Mónica Tavares's (Mo' Kalamity) voice is cool and laid-back, riding atop glossy, elegant yet fiery rhythms by her band, The Wizards.**"**

## Sophia Loizou — Silver Nemesis (Excerpt)
_Sanjay_: **"**Keron's reputation for blending the lyricism of hip-hop with the energy and melody of reggae and dancehall is on full display here: a scathing commentary on the decisions made by Jamaican politicians and neoliberal corporations at the expense of the island’s residents.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's all! Thanks for listening and much love to Romain Barbot and Gregory Buffier of Saåad for being our guests today, and to Camille Célestin for this episode's illustration!</p>
