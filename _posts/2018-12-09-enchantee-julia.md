<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome the French singer [Enchantée Julia](https://www.facebook.com/enchanteejulia/) to MailTape.
<br><br>
I discovered her a few months ago. It was the end of Summer, Paris was still warm and welcoming. I went to an event by the river where some artists were playing on a barge. Enchantée Julia was one of those artists, and her flow captivated me.

# Enchantée Julia's selection

## Triplego – Cali (feat Prince Waly)
_Echantée Julia_: **"**This song is a collaboration made in Montreuil : "Montreuil c'est Cali". I like the vaporous, the misty aspect of the track. Triplego's chorus is as catchy as usual, Prince Waly's voice imperturbable. It's a journey between California and Paris suburb !**"**

## Terrenoire – Le Silence
_Enchantée Julia_: **"**We change direction : Terrenoire near Saint Etienne, two souls, two brothers, two wonders searching for the Black Paradiso. Raphael's voice is transcendent, Theo's production is stunning. I travel, I can only listen to the track until the end and then play it again!**"**

## Saintard – Summertime
_Enchantée Julia_: **"**Now we are back to California, with Saintard, the king of groove. Some nostalgia from the nineties, I like it ! I am a big FAN **"**


# MailTape's selection

## Enchantée Julia – 45 tours (feat Prince Waly)
_Manon_: **"**The "Shalala"**"**

## Empress Of — Trust Me Baby
_Manon_: **"**This song is hypnotising. You listen to it one time, and you loose yourself in this blablabla**"**

## Moussa – Cabrioli
_Manon_: **"**Same crew as blablabla**"**

## LXTR – WWL (feat. CARME)
_Manon_: **"**Some sweetness to end this playlist, like a square of chocolate at the end of a meal...**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thank you so much for listening. Much love and respect to [Enchantée Julia](https://www.facebook.com/enchanteejulia/) for her Sunday selection, and to William for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
