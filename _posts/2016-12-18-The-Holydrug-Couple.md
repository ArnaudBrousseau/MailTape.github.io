<p id="introduction">This morning,</p>


# **The Holydrug Couple's selection**

+ ## Nicolas Godin - Widerstehe Doch Der Sünde
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This a song originally written by Bach, and re-made by Nicolas Godin by AIR. It's one of the songs that I most adore in the entire world and it's apt for every minute of every hour of the week. Simply majestic.**"**

+ ## Arco Corintio - Coronada
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This is from a new project I'm working on called Arco Corintio. I think it's perfect for a sunday morning, the time runs slow and you feel a lit of bit melancholic about the such a good time you had last nite on that party. Kinda of a gospel, it's just very simple with a couple of beautiful chords and driven by a mellow groovy bass and ace tone drum machine.

+ ## Valesuchi - Golosynth
_The Holydrug Couple_: **"**This one is from my friend Valesuchi, called Golosynth, in spanish something like ''sweet tooth for synths''. Perfect chill for a sunday morning without losing the necesary groovness to not to comeback to bed.

# **Mailtape's selection**

+ ## The Holydrug Couple - Concorde
_Dimitri_: **"****"**

+ ## Krakatau - Tharsis Montes
_Dimitri_: **"****"**

+ ## Phil Stroud - Flow
_Dimitri_: **"**Phil Stroud is an aussie's producer from Perth. He saids about this tracks "_I hope is that it provides you with the assistance you need to feel calm and energised, that it connects you with your spirit and grounds you to the earth._" I think indeed that this says it all.**"**

+ ## Mick Jenkins - Drowning feat. BadBadNotGood
_Dimitri_: **"**Mick Jenkins is a based Chicago rapper, few weeks ago he relased one of my best hip-hop album of the year entitled The Healing Component. Like this Drowning featuring BadBadNotGood his music is a kind of psychedelic hip-hop result of lot of experimentations which it reminds me on some points Outkast. Really inspiring.**"**
