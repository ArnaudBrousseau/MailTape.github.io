<p id="introduction">This morning we are delighted to welcome Stockholm-based electronic producer, [Sissel Wincent](https://soundcloud.com/sissel), to MailTape. In her own music, as well as within the [Drömfakulteten collective](https://dromfakulteten.tumblr.com/), Sissel deals in a congruous style of spacious and crisply detailed studio action, exploring the spaces behind and after the notes as much as what comes in between. 
<br><br>
Today's selection, however, trades in a joyous aqueous sound—with plenty of mallards, dolphin squeaks and alternating compressions.</p>


# Sara Serpa's selection

## Bela Bartok – Violin Duets, N.28 — Sorrow
_Sara Serpa_: **"**I have been learning Bela Bartok's vocal music for a year now, and it has been an incredible experience. I practiced the Mikrokosmos for Piano when I was a child, but this immersive practice has exposed me more to his music and compositions, and I just love it. From the vocal works, I started digging more into his instrumental music, and this particular violin duet has been on my mind for a while now.**"**

## Fanta Damba & Batourou Sekou Kouyaté – Tatou
_Sara Serpa_: **"**I discovered this singer's work recently. From Mali, she is still alive but retired in 1985. I love her voice, her sound, her phrasing, her time. I am drawn to her sound, and the combination of voice and cora is really beautiful.**"**

## Nina Simone – Just in Time (Live at The Village Gate)
_Sara Serpa_: **"**My favorite version of Just in Time, it is so different from all the other versions I have heard of this famous jazz standard. Nina Simone is so joyful here, there is so much space, her piano solo is incredible. The fact that was recorded live just shows her brilliance even more.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Sara Serpa & André Matos – Lisboa
_Sanjay_: **"**This tune, a nod to their old haunt, is in an airy but enigmatic space for me. Sara’s atmospherics over André's spare phrasing and minimalist percussion brings that to life after a purposefully tentative start.**"**

## Cécile McLorin Salvant – You've Got to Give Me Some
_Sanjay_: **"**Computerised, dubbed out percussion and samples meld with guitars, wah tubes, bass, pianet, and the percussive world of snare drum experiments and rhythmic balafon. Understated and playful.**"**

## Amira Kheir – Amwaj (Waves)
_Sanjay_: **"**Amira Kheir [picked a few Sunday morning tunes for us](https://www.mailta.pe/282/amira-kheir/) back in October 2017. She has since released a new album—[Mystic Dance](http://amirakheir.com/)—and this is its opening track. Its hypnotic, mellow and steady rhythm, alongside a modestly groovy bass, melodically evoking its name.**"**

## Meeta Pandit – Thumri Pilu (Live)
_Sanjay_: **"**No stranger to MailTape, Eric Douglas Porter picked some Sunday morning tunes for us alongside Gaël Segalen as [Les Graciés](https://www.mailta.pe/319/les-gracies/) back in July. As [Afrikan Sciences](https://soundcloud.com/afrikan-sciences), however, Eric's study of rhythm fixates on the oddities—the mutations, the dualities and instances of bare collision.**"**


<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always thanks so much for listening! Much love and respect to [Sara Serpa](https://www.saraserpa.com/) for her Sunday selections, and to [Camille Célestin](http://bravocamo.studio/) for this episode's cool illustration.</p>
