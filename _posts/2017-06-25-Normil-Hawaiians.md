<p id="introduction">This morning, we are delighted to welcome [Normil Hawaiians](http://normilhawaiians.com/). Operating more like a collective than a band, the Normil Hawaiians formed in the austere post-punk permafrost of 1980s UK.</p>
<p>Under the continuities of racial and economic imperialism and in the grip of another ruthless despot, freedom was in part personified by the widely vilified and brutally attacked people's Peace Convoy – a manifestation of idealism that was grotesquely smashed near Stonehenge on 1 June 1985; 537 arrested, children terrorised, idealism and hope stamped on with fear and violence.</p>
<p>In their own words, 'come rejoice with us; all that falls, now falls into place... and all that was air now becomes solid'.</p>

# Normil Hawaiians's selection


## Fela Kuti - Power Show (Edit)
_Guy_: **"**...I woke up one Sunday morning in (photographer) Fin Costello's house in Islington with my girlfriend Irena in a double poster bed... one of those wonderful 4 storey London town houses, to the smell of fresh coffee and the sound of Fela Kuti's Power Show wafting up the stairs. My friend Tony Harrison who was Fin's assistant had been doing a photo shoot with us whilst Fin was away. The studio was in the basement - it was the same one that the cover of Japan's Tin Drum was shot... What a beautiful morning that was and Power Show just encapsulates freedom, defiance, rebellion... but most of all joy and harmony, it's just beautiful... 10 minutes or so of pure life! It also was a reminder that you can take people on a proper musical journey in 10 minutes..."**"**

## Isao Tomita - Arabesque No. 1 (Claude Debussy)
_Simon_: **"**This was a formative recording for me as it introduced me to two musical influences that have remained with me ever since; I was not at all familiar with the music of Claude Debussy prior to my 17th birthday when this record was given to me by my friend John and I had had only minimal exposure to electronic pieces at this stage in my life. However, [the picture on the back of this album](http://assets.coolhunting.com/coolhunting/chad-assets/cover_photos/2016/5/572ffff26232620012010000/large.jpg?1462763505) always fascinated me, as did the mystery imbued in Debussy's beautiful works...**"**

## Neu! - Hallo Gallo
_Noel_: **"**I like Hallo Gallo as it goes, was playing it yesterday in fact. Sunday no less, while cooking dinner!**"**

_Mark_: **"**Neu was interesting to me when I first heard it as a teenager as it challenged my preconceptions of what was passing as music... it also set on edge the American ideals of rock n roll... it was coming from a very modern European aspect and one that was tackling an immediate difficult past... trying to build a clearer tomorrow... it seemed free and I wanted to be freed.**"**

# MailTape's selection

## Normil Hawaiians - Yellow Rain
_Sanjay_: **"**After a hiatus just about as long as my entire lifetime, I was thrilled to hear that the ranters were back to perform their previously-shelved third album at London's Cafe OTO.**"**

## Les Filles De Illighadad - Fatou
_Sanjay_: **"**The most recent time I saw [Marisa Anderson](https://marisaandersonmusic.com/) perform was in a small loft at [The Old Hairdresser's](http://theoldhairdressers.com/) in Glasgow. And I could listen to her music all day on repeat. Bass notes often drone with presence and open strings are laden with sparks that are usually hidden. It makes gestures toward loud, but it's more about solitude for me. This is one of many selections I could have gone with.**"**

## Annette Peacock - Survival
_Sanjay_: **"**An oldie but a goodie from London-based musician, [Karen Gwyer](http://karengwyer.com/). This track was produced after London's Public Information label invited some contemporary musicians to reinterpret the work of electronics pioneer [F.C. Judd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Judd). This track fills the space around the source material with percussion and lolling melodic lines, using the "fiddly complexity" of Judd's rhythms from 'Drum Song' as a springboard to have some real fun.**"**

## A Silver Mt. Zion - The Triumph of our Tired Eyes
_Sanjay_: **"**The title track from [Carla dal Forno](https://www.facebook.com/carladalfornoyes/)'s debut album, 'You Know What It’s Like', feels like it lurks somewhere in the familiar shadowy greys and stark minimalism of much of her previous output. It opens with a distorted, wind-chime sort of jingling before the drums kick in with a relentlessly steady beat. A perfect end to this hypnotic and dreamy issue.**"**
