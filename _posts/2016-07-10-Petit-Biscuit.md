-Day Wave - Drag : This track just makes me wanna go out of my bed and enjoy my life, but also makes me think of holidays, summer, friends, love, lot of the most beautiful things in this world.



Mura Masa - ...Girls : This one makes me wanna chill with a big cup of coffee.


Flume - Take A Chance (ft. Little Dragon) : I just bought the limited vinyl edition. And all the tracks his album are absolutely incredible, this one puts me definitely in a good mood, to wake me up with a big smile.
