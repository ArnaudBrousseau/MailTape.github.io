# Fragments' morning inspiration
 
## Maps - A.M.A
_Benjamin:_ **"**A real pop song you will have in mind for the rest of the day. For going on with the party you started the night before as well as for waking up with a smile on your face.**"**
 
## Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Round and Round
_Tom:_ **"**This song is a cure to melancholia. The bridge at two minutes feels just like a sunny Sunday. If everyone listened to Ariel Pink, people may less bit the crap out of each other.**"**
 
## Julien Marchal - I
_Sylvain:_ **"**Because it's fluffy. Because the sound of the piano is just a wonder. Even more because he's a Frenchy.**"**
