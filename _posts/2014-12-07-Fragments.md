<p id="introduction">
This morning, here's a Mailtape inspired by [Fragments](https://www.facebook.com/frgmntsmusic "Fragments' Facebook Page"). If you're not waking up in a good mood by the end of this sunday selection, we can't do anything for you. Enjoy the lively rhythm of these tracks and you will be powered for the rest of the day. </p>
 
# Ethearal vibes

Fragments' music is all about freedom. Impossible to put them inside a tiny little box that defines a musical genre. Without any words, they express their own poetry. You just have to close your eyes and imagine a magical land made of their music. 

Their morning selection is a perfect mirror to how eclectic their inspirations are. From the soaring chorus to the kind piano melody. You just have to let your mind wander.

# Fragments' morning inspiration
 
## Maps - A.M.A
_Benjamin:_ **"**A real pop song you will have in mind for the rest of the day. For going on with the party you started the night before as well as for waking up with a smile on your face.**"**
 
## Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Round and Round
_Tom:_ **"**This song is a cure to melancholia. The bridge at two minutes feels just like a sunny Sunday. If everyone listened to Ariel Pink, people may less bit the crap out of each other.**"**
 
## Julien Marchal - I
_Sylvain:_ **"**Because it's soft. Because the sound of the piano is just a wonder. Even more because he's a Frenchy.**"**

That’s all folks! A big thank to our guest [Fragments](https://www.facebook.com/frgmntsmusic "Fragments' Facebook Page") for their morning selection, to Jérôme Sevrette for the picture and to Tanguy. Enjoy your sunday.
