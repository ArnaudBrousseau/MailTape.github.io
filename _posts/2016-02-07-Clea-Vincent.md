<p id="introduction">Salut! comment ça va? Bien ou bien? Yes, this morning we gonna speak in french, or rather speak in english about the revival of French pop. The new waves of bands who sing mostly in french. A things that french pop singers had almost forget to. It's not a patriotic phenomenon but a strong desire to open the gates with a language that we control more than all others. I began to dive in this musical revolution when I saw Cléa Vincent in concert for the first time, what a souvenir! And now there are plenty of references who I treasure. </p>

# My new queen of French pop

For this new generation, to sing in french wasn't a choice but a deep desire, almost an evidence. Artists like Clea Vincent write their songs, inspired by the golden age of French pop, the 80's. Their songs resonate in the hearts of French youth. I think that is the formula : singing in french resonate in present French Youth. 

Clea Vincent's songs are falsely naive and full of metaphors. Flippant exquisite poetry. It's not innocent that she chose a song from "Les Beaux Gosses" (_Flairs - Bus_), this movie is a part of our new cultural pantheon. I think it's just the beginning. It takes time to uninhibite our generation to considered a new way to make pop in french. But now, I expect a huge tsunami of greats bands who gonna reshape our pop in french. 


# La délicieuse séléction de Clea Vincent 
 
## Ricky Hollywood - Parti dans le passé (Athanase Granson edit)
Cléa Vincent : " _Ricky Hollywood and Athanase Granson are two artists of the Parisian indie scene that I love, each have their distinct project. Their songs are allways soft. Ricky got an 80's poetry, Athanase is more inspired by 60's weird psychedelic folk. It's the perfect music for sunday mornings!_ "

## Flairs - Bus
C.V.: "_ This one is in the original soundtrack of my favorite movie : "Les Beaux Gosses" de Riad Sattouf_"

## Kumi Solo - Ce soir
C.V.: " _I recently wrote a songs for Kumi, I really enjoyed working with her, she's so cute!!! I'm her best fan!_“
