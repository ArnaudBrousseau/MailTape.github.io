<p id="introduction">Close your eyes and float away in a blissful auditory dream courtesy of Paris-based guitarist, [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/). He provides us with a sweet Sunday morning glimpse into Canada's contemporary music milieu.</p>
<p>In his own music, melodies are teased out, textures repeat and the tempo often remains a leisurely stroll as he muses over motifs—love, moonlight, longing, intimacy, interdependence.</p>


# MALFNKTION's selection


## Wild Belle – Love Like This
_MALFNKTION_: **"**Natalie Bergman's breezy vocals and the uplifting melody and lyrics of this song make for a perfect morning listen. The entire album 'Isles' is great.**"**

## Emancipator – Bat Country
_MALFNKTION_: **"**Any song by Emancipator is great for starting your day. It's my go-to-listen for downtempo vibes. This song is from his most recent album 'Baralku'. I picked this because I got to watch him play this album live when he came to India a few months back. Needless to say, it surpassed all my expectations. The entire album is a must-listen! **"**

## Anderson Paak — The Dreamer (feat. Talib Kweli & Timan Family Choir)
_MALFNKTION_: **"**Anderson Paak is positivity personified. It was really hard to pick just one song of his. I think he says it best: 'This one's for all the little dreamers. And the ones who never gave a fuck!'**"**


# MailTape's selection

## MALFNKTION & Zoya – Be Free
_Sanjay_: **"**'Slowly Paradise' is [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/)’s new solo record—a collection of songs filled with soothing, honeyed singing and bent, frazzled fretwork. On this track, the melody dissolves into improvisation, leaving a haze of wah pedals, loose strums and electronics that float on the surface like glints of sunlight on a dewy morning.**"**

## Yaeji – drink i'm sippin on
_Sanjay_: **"**[Tashi Dorji](https://tashidorji.com/)'s music is at once frenetic and tranquil. But it's tranquility I'm concerned about this morning with this track from the 2015 split LP alongside Marisa Anderson. It's a rolling and meditative five minutes that cycles its way around an abstract melody with clipped harmonics and stuttering fret work.**"**

##  Dualist Inquiry – Soleil
_Sanjay_: **"**[Marisa Anderson](https://marisaandersonmusic.com/)'s fourth album sounds like one long ride into the sunset. Otherworldy landscapes and deft playing aside, this title track is a dark reverie that sounds both foreboding and delicate, like wind rustling through leaves under a full moon.**"**

## Tigue – .......
_Sanjay_: **"**Founded as a string quartet in 2014 in Cape Town, [Shh..Art Ensemble](http://shhart.com/) is now a flexible configuration of players including strings, vocals, electronics and a range of Southern African instruments. Originally recorded by Massive Attack and Ghostpoet, this composition—arranged by [previous MailTape guest Cara Stacey](https://www.mailta.pe/247/cara-stacey/)—sounds so relaxed yet casually surreal, as if lying awake beneath the stars.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
