<p id="introduction">This morning we are excited to welcome [MALFNKTION](https://malfnktion.bandcamp.com/), the electronic music project of Bengaluru-based musician Aditya Alamuru.</p>
<p>The project derives its sound from hip-hop compositions, classical Indian music, old Indian film music and audio recordings taken from the streets of Mumbai to sounds collected in remote parts of the country. His debut EP ‘[Hindustani Rascal](https://soundcloud.com/malfnktion/sets/hindustani-rascal-ep)’, released in 2015, was a homage to the golden age of Indian cinema, and his second EP, ‘[Vote for Worms](https://soundcloud.com/malfnktion/sets/vote-for-worms)’, was released in December 2016.</p>


# MALFNKTION's selection


## Wild Belle – Love Like This
_MALFNKTION_: **"**[Natalie Bergman](http://www.wildbelle.com/dreamland)'s breezy vocals and the uplifting melody and lyrics of this song make for a perfect morning listen. The entire album 'Isles' is great.**"**

## Emancipator – Bat Country
_MALFNKTION_: **"**Any song by [Emancipator](http://emancipatormusic.com/) is great for starting your day. It's my go-to-listen for downtempo vibes. This song is from his most recent album 'Baralku'. I picked this because I got to watch him play this album live when he came to India a few months back. Needless to say, it surpassed all my expectations. The entire album is a must-listen! **"**

## Anderson Paak — The Dreamer (feat. Talib Kweli & Timan Family Choir)
_MALFNKTION_: **"**[Anderson Paak](http://www.andersonpaak.com/) is positivity personified. It was really hard to pick just one song of his. I think he says it best: 'This one's for all the little dreamers. And the ones who never gave a fuck!'**"**


# MailTape's selection

## MALFNKTION & Zoya – Be Free
_Sanjay_: **"**'Slowly Paradise' is [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/)’s new solo record—a collection of songs filled with soothing, honeyed singing and bent, frazzled fretwork. On this track, the melody dissolves into improvisation, leaving a haze of wah pedals, loose strums and electronics that float on the surface like glints of sunlight on a dewy morning.**"**

## Yaeji – drink i'm sippin on
_Sanjay_: **"**Rapping in Korean, the New York City and Seoul-based producer Kathy Yaeji Lee delivers a nonchalant and breathy vocal track that glides over propulsive drums instead of sinking right into them.**"**

##  Dualist Inquiry – Soleil
_Sanjay_: **"**Dualist Inquiry is the solo electronic dance project of Sahej Bakshi, a producer, guitarist and composer from New Delhi.**"**

## Tigue – .......
_Sanjay_: **"**Founded as a string quartet in 2014 in Cape Town, [Shh..Art Ensemble](http://shhart.com/) is now a flexible configuration of players including strings, vocals, electronics and a range of Southern African instruments. Originally recorded by Massive Attack and Ghostpoet, this composition—arranged by [previous MailTape guest Cara Stacey](https://www.mailta.pe/247/cara-stacey/)—sounds so relaxed yet casually surreal, as if lying awake beneath the stars.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Eric Chenaux](http://ericchenaux.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
