<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome multilingual singer, songwriter and musician, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch). With songs in Swiss German, English, Jamaican Patois, Spanish and French, he represents a culture of co-existence without boundaries based on language, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>While his music has its origins in roots reggae, he has recently complemented it with dub, bossa nova, rap and blues elements. His latest remix album, [Dub Ripe Fruit](https://soundcloud.com/ariwasounds/sets/dub-ripe-fruits-elijah-rajing-fyah-joe-ariwa), is a collaboration with the Jamaican band [Raging Fyah](http://ragingfyah.com/) and [Joe Ariwa](http://ariwa.com/), the son of dub and reggae legend Mad Professor.</p>


# Elijah Salomon's selection


## Dennis Brown – Have You Ever
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**Dennis Brown is one of my favourite artists of all time and just yesterday I woke up with this song. Perfect music to set the vibe for a chilled Sunday.**"**

## Burning Spear – Mi Gi Dem
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**Burning Spear always gives you an upfull energy—this is one of his many anthems to get up and live!**"**

## Damian Marley ft. Stephen Marley – Medication
_Elijah Salomon_: **"**The vibe right now is time to meditate. Hit song from Damian Marley's new album 'Stony Hill'. Takes you high.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Elijah Salomon – Power to the Dub
_Sanjay_: **"**Not only impressive in its musical diversity, [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch)'s album is more than just a series of Roots songs—it's a call to slow down, to exhale and let things run their course and mature into their natural destiny!**"**

## Aba-Shanti-I – Tower of Babel
_Sanjay_: **"**The musical moniker of Paul Régimbeau, [Mondkopf](http://mondkopf.tumblr.com/)'s electronic music often feels extremely literal. This track is taken from the [Musique Ambiante Française Vol. 1](https://tigersushirecords.bandcamp.com/album/musique-ambiante-fran-aise-vol-1) compilation on Tigersushi. It's a serene and seductive suite of ambient or beatless works using old and new analog machines.**"**

## Mo' Kalamity – Darling
_Sanjay_: **"**A studied enactment of both vision and virtuosity, Tropismes is taken from [Christine Ott](http://www.christineott.fr/)'s solo album, 'Only Silence Remains'. Shadowy and minimal, the melody is subtly sketched and the arrangement given ample space and light.**"**

## Kabaka Pyramid – No Capitalist
_Sanjay_: **"**A beautiful collaboration in which Fernando Corona (Murcof) and Vanessa Wagner sensitively condense and escalate elements of Arvo Pärt’s 'Variations for the Healing of Arinushka' from lonely piano and spectral electronics to a grandiose swell of strings, keys and marching drums, before returning to quietude.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it! Thanks for listening and much gratitude to [Elijah Salomon](https://www.elijah.ch/) for being our guest today, and to [William Girault](http://williamgirault.com/) for this episode's illustration!</p>
