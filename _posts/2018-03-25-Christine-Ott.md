<p id="introduction">Based in Strasbourg and only one of a tiny handful of performers on the ondes Martenot, this Sunday morning we welcome [Christine Ott](http://www.christineott.fr/) to collaborate with us on MailTape.</p>
<p>Toying with mood and tone with practiced ease in her own work, Christine has also been an integral part of Yann Tiersen's band and has collaborated with the likes of Radiohead, Tindersticks, Syd Matters, Daau, Raphelson, Noir Désir, Vénus, Oiseaux-Tempête and Foudre! over the past two decades.</p>


# Christine Ott's selection


## Rachel Grimes – The Air in Time
_Christine Ott_: **"**I discovered Rachel's work through Richard Knox from my most recent album's label, Gizeh Records. He found that we had a close musical universe, I took it as a comploment! Quite a short piece, but full of energy with some Asian inspiration in the spring part. I hope I would cross the Atlantic to meet her one day. I really like her recent work with Loscil too.**"**

## David Lang by Bang on a Can – Cheating, Lying, Stealing
_Christine Ott_: **"**Sunday morning, in contrast to the first piece...and at the same time, repetitive and evolving music which takes the time of a nice development. I love this piece of David Lang, especially this first movement by his Bang on a Can.The recording is great, as is the use and choice of special sounds of percussions. A surprising and original piece of music! The North American contemporary scene is really interesting to me.**"**

## Fink – Looking Too Closely
_Christine Ott_: **"**Sunday morning, riding on an endless road to the countryside...Fink's lastest album has really great pieces of indie rock, especially 'Who Says', 'Green and the Blue', and 'Warm Shadows'. I also really like the way that this album has been produced.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Christine Ott – Szczecin
_Sanjay_: **"**'Szczecin' is taken from Christine Ott's 2016 solo album, [Only Silence Remains](http://www.gizehrecords.com/gzh66-christine-ott-only-silence-remains.html). Like Szczecin, the whole album is a subtly-sketched melodic recording, with the arrangements given ample space as Christine performs on a variety of instruments throughout the record.**"**

## Littleboat – ARC
_Sanjay_: **"**[Chris](http://chrislittleboat.tumblr.com/) is a musician based in Bristol, UK, working as a composer, performer and sound designer with [The Paper Cinema](http://www.thepapercinema.com/). This piece is a quartet for clarinet, violin, cello and piano inspired in part by Oliver Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps, and performed by the [Octandre Ensemble](https://www.octandre.com/).**"**

## Mary Lattimore – The Quiet at Night
_Sanjay_: **"**The title of this song means 'when I’m riding my horse' in Haitian Creole, and there's a suitably bright sway to it. [Mélissa](https://www.facebook.com/melissalaveauxoff) takes traditional tunes, vodou anthems and scraps and phrases discovered in old songbooks, and sews them together like a patchwork of intersecting lives.**"**

## Saltland – ICA
_Sanjay_: **"**Meaning 'be strong' in Urhobo, [Kokoroko](https://www.facebook.com/kokorokomusic/) return with this contribution to Brownswood Recording's recent compilation, [We Out Here](https://weouthere.bandcamp.com/album/we-out-here). A beautifully melodic track to listen to whilst your morning coffee percolates, opening with lightly picked guitars and somber percussion.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
