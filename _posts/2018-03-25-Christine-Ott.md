<p id="introduction">Based in Strasbourg and only one of a tiny handful of performers on the ondes Martenot, this morning we welcome Christine Ott to collaborate with us on MailTape.</p>
<p>Merging folk textures with jazz melodies, Miryam followed her debut 2014 EP, [Evergreen](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/evergreen), with her second EP, [Magnolia](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia), last year. Inspired by feminist psychoanalysis, vocal improvisation, Ghanaian high life and dreams of Scandinavia, Miryam's music is also conjugated by  polyrhythms from drummer Seb Rochford. Shabaka Hutchings on clarinet, bassist Jean Berthon and drummer Tansay Omar also feature.</p>


# Christine Ott's selection


## Rachel Grimes – The Air in Time
_Christine Ott_: **"**I discovered Rachel's work through Richard Knox from my most recent album's label, Gizeh Records. He found that we had a close musical universe, I took it as a comploment! Quite a short piece, but full of energy with some Asian inspiration in the spring part. I hope I would cross the Atlantic to meet her one day. I really like her recent work with Loscil too.**"**

## David Lang by Bang on a Can – Cheating, Lying, Stealing
_Christine Ott_: **"**Sunday morning, in contrast to the first piece...and at the same time, repetitive and evolving music which takes the time of a nice development. I love this piece of David Lang, especially this first movement by his Bang on a Can.The recording is great, as is the use and choice of special sounds of percussions. A surprising and original piece of music! The North American contemporary scene is really interesting to me.**"**

## Fink – Looking Too Closely
_Christine Ott_: **"**Sunday morning, riding on an endless road to the countryside...Fink's lastest album has really great pieces of indie rock, especially 'Who Says', 'Green and the Blue', and 'Warm Shadows'. I also really like the way that this album has been produced.**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Christine Ott – Szczecin
_Sanjay_: **"**Easy and unhurried, this downtempo track from Miryam's latest EP, [Magnolia](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/magnolia), feels like the perfect accompaniment to Sunday morning for me.**"**

## Littleboat – ARC
_Sanjay_: **"**This five-piece band united by [Alfa](https://alfamist.bandcamp.com/) on keys are making some beautifully harmonious and melancholic music right now. This makes me want to stay wrapped inside my warm duvet on a Sunday morning...**"**

## Mary Lattimore – The Quiet at Night
_Sanjay_: **"**The title of this song means 'when I’m riding my horse' in Haitian Creole, and there's a suitably bright sway to it. [Mélissa](https://www.facebook.com/melissalaveauxoff) takes traditional tunes, vodou anthems and scraps and phrases discovered in old songbooks, and sews them together like a patchwork of intersecting lives.**"**

## Saltland – ICA
_Sanjay_: **"**Meaning 'be strong' in Urhobo, [Kokoroko](https://www.facebook.com/kokorokomusic/) return with this contribution to Brownswood Recording's recent compilation, [We Out Here](https://weouthere.bandcamp.com/album/we-out-here). A beautifully melodic track to listen to whilst your morning coffee percolates, opening with lightly picked guitars and somber percussion.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. Thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to [Miryam Solomon](https://miryamsolomonmusic.bandcamp.com/) for being our guest today, and to [Pierre-Julien Fieux](http://www.pierrejulienfieux.com/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
