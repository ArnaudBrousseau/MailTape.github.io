<p id="introduction">This morning we welcome the lyrical, dreamy and funky Sunday morning selections of [Les Graciés](https://soundcloud.com/les-gracies)—a French-American tandem of a brother and a sister in sound, an evident and karmic encounter of free spirit music makers in full sympathy with the unknown.</p>
<p>Les Graciés is the conjunction of Eric Douglas Porter ([Afrikan Sciences](https://soundcloud.com/afrikan-sciences)) and Gaël Segalen ([IhearU](http://ihearu.org/)). In their own music, they transcend styles with a deceptive effortlessness conflating sheets of street noise and organic pastoral location recordings with rhythms that seem to have spilled from the field to the club via decades of cryptic encoding.</p>
<p> If you're in London, Eric and Gaël will be performing together at [Cafe OTO on Monday 16th July](https://cafeoto.co.uk/events/les-gracies/).</p>


# Kaja Draksler's selection


## Tahiti Choir – Tahiti Choir Music
_Kaja Draksler_: **"**Folk music always has a very strong impact on me, especially when there are voices involved. This is a choir from Tahiti.**"**

## Craig Taborn – This Voice Says So
_Kaja Draksler_: **"**One of my favorite pianists. His solo album [Avenging Angel](http://player.ecmrecords.com/taborn) is just magic. I hope he releases another solo soon.**"**

## Jacobus Gallus – Mirabile Misterium
_Kaja Draksler_: **"**A Slovenian renessaince composer sang by [Huelgas Ensemble](http://www.huelgasensemble.be/index.php?Itemid=68). You can never hear enough of this!**"**


# MailTape's selection

## Kaja Draksler – Gledalec
_Sanjay_: **"**I've been listening to '[Low Doses](https://firecrackerrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/firec020-low-doses)' from Les Graciés on repeat for most of this year. It's a genre-defying LP with a curious fusion of mystic beat geometry and electro-acoustic process unshackled from restrictive rhythmic lexicon. A hypnotic and trippy journey!**"**

## Cara Stacey & Camilo Ángeles – Cederberg
_Sanjay_: **"**Alexandra Drewchin's '[Eartheater](http://www.eartheater.solar/)' project is an equally omnivorous offering this morning. Skittering and folding in on itself, Alexandra experiments with varying ratios of the technological and the analogue and synthesises them into a dreamy cosmic lullaby.**"**

##  Angelica Sanchez Trio – What the Birds Tell Me
_Sanjay_: **"**[Elysia Crampton](https://soundcloud.com/eande/) is another musician who traces circuitous paths—motifs circling back upon themselves, transitioning into different planes, covering territories that are in constant flux, their boundaries reforming as they are conjured. Elysia's [self-titled album](https://breakworldrecords.bandcamp.com/album/elysia-crampton-3) 'further situates her work within a long Aymaran musical legacy[*](https://breakworldrecords.bandcamp.com/album/elysia-crampton-3) that implicates cultures & sites beyond the Andes (following trajectories of dispersion through the literal migration & interaction of bodies & in the circulation of Aymaran concepts, images, music & goods via the world market after the conquest)'.**"**

## Central Australian Aboriginal Women’s Choir – Jesu Nganalala
_Sanjay_: **"**Alongside Eric's first choice by Joni Mitchell this morning, [Kate Bush](http://katebush.com/) is another of my favourite contemporary precocious songwriters with the ability to convey powerful human stories. Army Dreamers is a mournful waltz written from the perspective of a bereaved mother. It’s an anti-war song that successfully treads the line between compassion and condescension. Lamenting the waste of life that inevitably occurs when young men see military glory as their only realistic chance of advancement, it’s as pertinent today as it was 37 years ago.**"**

<p id="outroduction">That's it for this morning. As always, thanks for listening and much love and gratitude to Eric and Gaël as [Les Graciés](https://soundcloud.com/les-gracies), and to [Anthony Dujardin](https://www.instagram.com/fromthegarden/) for this episode's cool illustration!</p>
