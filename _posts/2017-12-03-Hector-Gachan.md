# Hector Gachan's selection



## Yuko Yuko – Two Boys
_Hector Gachan_: **"**This a track and a half right here folks. Pure psychedelic pop with a cheeky 80's feel to it. Catchy as hell. Wonderful female lead vocals with some call and response like chorus backed up by Yuko Yuko's Elias. So Mashallah!**"**

## Jermango Dreaming - I Want You
_Hector Gachan_: **"**Smooth as butter. Jermango serves us 'I Want You' a tune of pure love, longing and reassurance. No matter the distance or situation... He and I still want you.. Good enough to eat, good enough to dunk in your coffee. Clean sound all round, swinging beat, mid 20th century pop finesse, keys and a solo good enough to get your granny rockin'. Mashallah!**"**

## Jerry Paper - Everything is Shitty
_Hector Gachan_: **"**As soon as this randomly popped up on my lappy.. I knew this was exactly where I wanted to be musically that sunday mornin'.. Lyrically the track is pretty insane. Extremely dark and yet so serene musically. Warm organs, multi layered vocals singing along with gorgeous high pitched female sampled vocals. The song is a dystopian sonic venture. Perfect way to start the end of your week. To quote a random youtube comment on this track "It's like if vaporwave was actually music." Mashallah...**"**
