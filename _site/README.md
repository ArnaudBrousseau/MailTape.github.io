MailTape
===========

Why ?
------
MailTape used to be made out of static html handwritten. Over the years it became quiet painful for Ludo and me, althought we had a few scripts to help us. Over that goes the fact that I believe a consistant user experience is essential to keep our listeners engaged and a different layout every tens post is clearly not helping in that way.

It was about time to make it more simple. Creating an episode is all about letting go and focusing on the best music curation and storytelling in order to keep our audience pleased every sunday morning. Spending energy on copy/pasting snippets of code in another html wasn't really helpful in that way.

Before telling more let's get back to work and make this happen. Introduction later ;)
