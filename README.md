MailTape
===========

Why ?
------
MailTape used to be made out of static html handwritten. Very dirty I assume but I didn't have the time to make it better, choosing to focus on content for our audience. Over the years, it became quiet painful for Ludo and me, althought we had a few scripts to help us. Add to this the fact that a different layout every ten posts is clearly not helping in building a consistant and engaging user experience.

Now we're welcoming new curators, it was about time to make it more simple. Creating an episode is all about letting go and focusing on the best music curation and storytelling in order to keep our audience pleased every sunday morning. Spending energy on copy/pasting snippets of code in another html wasn't really helpful in that way.
